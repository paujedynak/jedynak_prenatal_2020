It is thought to derive from a Ty3-gyspy LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposon and retains Gag and Pol-like domains. Here we show that the Gag domain of PEG10 can promote vesicle budding similar to the HIV p24 Gag protein. Expressed in a subset of mouse endocrine organs in addition to the placenta, PEG10 was identified as a substrate of the deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X. Consistent with PEG10 having a critical role in placental development, PEG10-deficient trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) exhibited impaired differentiation into placental lineages. PEG10 expressed in wild-type, differentiating TSCs was bound to many cellular RNAs including Hbegf (Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor), which is known to play an important role in placentation. Expression of Hbegf was reduced in PEG10-deficient TSCs suggesting that PEG10 might bind to and stabilize RNAs that are critical for normal placental development.},

  abstract = {Background: Air pollution exposure represents a major health threat to the developing foetus. DNA methylation is one of the most well-known molecular determinants of the epigenetic status of cells. Blood DNA methylation has been proven sensitive to air pollutants, but the molecular impact of air pollution on new-borns has so far received little attention. Objectives: We investigated whether nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM10), temperature and humidity during pregnancy are associated with differences in placental DNA methylation levels. Methods: Whole-genome DNA-methylation was measured using the Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in the placenta of 668 newborns from the EDEN cohort. We designed an original strategy using a priori biological information to focus on candidate genes with a specific expression pattern in placenta (active or silent) combined with an agnostic epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We used robust linear regression to identify CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMR) associated with each exposure during short- and longterm time-windows. Results: The candidate genes approach identified nine CpGs mapping to 9 genes associated with prenatal NO2 and PM10 exposure [false discovery rate (FDR) p {$<$} 0.05]. Among these, the methylation level of 2 CpGs located in ADORA2B remained significantly associated with NO2 exposure during the 2nd trimester and whole pregnancy in the EWAS (FDR p {$<$} 0.05). EWAS further revealed associations between the environmental exposures under study and variations of DNA methylation of 4 other CpGs. We further identified 27 DMRs significantly (FDR p {$<$} 0.05) associated with air pollutants exposure and 13 DMRs with meteorological conditions. Conclusions: The methylation of ADORA2B, a gene whose expression was previously associated with hypoxia and pre-eclampsia, was consistently found here sensitive to atmospheric pollutants. In addition, air pollutants were associated to DMRs pointing towards genes previously implicated in preeclampsia, hypertensive and metabolic disorders. These findings demonstrate that air pollutants exposure at levels commonly experienced in the European population are associated with placental gene methylation and provide some mechanistic insight into some of the reported effects of air pollutants on preeclampsia.},

  abstract = {Acetaminophen is considered the safest antipyretic and analgesic medication for pregnant women. However, studies have reported that acetaminophen has endocrine disrupting properties and prenatal exposure has been associated with early life epigenetic changes and later life health outcomes. As the placenta is the central mediator of maternal and fetal interactions, exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy could manifest as perturbations in the placenta epigenome. Here, we evaluated epigenome-wide cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) methylation in placental tissue in relation to maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy in a cohort of 286 newborns born prior to 28 weeks gestation. According to maternal self-report, more than half (166 of 286) of the newborns were exposed to acetaminophen in utero. After adjustment for potential confounders, a total of 42 CpGs were identified to be differentially methylated at a false discovery rate {$<$} 0.05, with most displaying increased methylation as it relates to acetaminophen exposure. A notable gene that was significantly associated with acetaminophen is the prostaglandin receptor (PTGDR) which plays an essential role in mediating placental blood flow and fetal growth. Moreover, for 6 of the 42 CpGs, associations of acetaminophen use with methylation were significantly different between male and female placentas; 3 CpG sites were associated with acetaminophen use in the male placenta and 3 different sites were associated with acetaminophen use in the female placenta (Pinteraction {$<$} 0.2). These findings highlight a relationship between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the placental epigenome and suggest that the responses for some CpG sites are sex dependent.},

  abstract = {Background: The gut microbiome plays an important role in the development of disease. The composition of the microbiome is influenced by factors such as mode of delivery at birth, diet and antibiotic use, yet the influence of environmental chemical exposures is largely unknown. The antimicrobial compound triclosan, found in many personal care products and widely detected in human urine, is an environmental exposure for which systemic microbiotic effects may be of particular interest. To investigate the relationship between triclosan and gut microflora, we assessed the association between triclosan and enterolactone, an intestinal metabolite that is produced via bacterial transformation of dietary lignans (seeds, nuts) and has known susceptibility to oral antibiotics. Methods: We examined urinary triclosan and enterolactone for 2005-2008 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey subjects, aged Z20 years (n {$\frac{1}{4}$}3041). We also examined the association between prescription antibiotic use and enterolactone to confirm its susceptibility to changes in bacterial composition of the body. Associations between natural log-transformed enterolactone and (1) detected vs. not detected ( o2.3 ng/mL) triclosan, (2) triclosan quintiles (Q1\textendash Q5), and (3) any vs. no antibiotics were estimated with multiple linear regression, adjusting for sex, age, race, body mass index, poverty income ratio, education, fiber intake, bowel movement frequency, cotinine and creatinine (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2441). Results: Triclosan was detected in 80\% of subjects (range: o 2.3\textendash 3620 ng/mL), while enterolactone was detected in 4 99\% of subjects (range: o0.1\textendash 122,000 ng/mL). After adjustment, enterolactone was not associated with triclosan (detect vs. non-detect: {$\beta\frac{1}{4}$} 0.07 (95\% CI: \`A 0.15, 0.30); Q5 (Z 104.5 ng/mL) vs. Q1 (none): {$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.06 (95\% CI: \`A 0.21, 0.34)). In sex-stratified analyses, triclosan was associated with higher enterolactone in women (detect vs. non-detect: {$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.31 (95\% CI: \`A 0.07, 0.70), but not men {$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A 0.18 (95\% CI: \`A 0.47, 0.11). However, any antibiotic use (n {$\frac{1}{4}$}112), as compared to no antibiotic use, was associated with significantly lower enterolactone ({$\beta$} {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A 0.78 (95\%CI: \`A 1.22, \`A0.36)), with no sex-specific effects. This association was driven by inverse associations with the following antibiotic classes: macrolide derivatives, quinolones, sulfonamides, and lincomycin derivatives. Conclusions: Antibiotics, but not triclosan, are negatively associated with urinary enterolactone. Antibiotics may reduce enterolactone by killing certain gut bacteria. At levels detected in the U.S., triclosan does not appear to be acting similarly, despite broad antimicrobial properties. Additional study of determinants of triclosan exposure and enterolactone production may be needed to better understand positive associations among women.},

  abstract = {Background Although urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites are frequently used as biomarkers in epidemiologic studies, variability during pregnancy has not been characterized. Methods We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in spot urine samples collected from 246 pregnant Dominican and African-American women. Twenty-eight women had repeat urine samples collected over a 6-week period. We also analyzed 48-hr personal air samples (n = 96 women) and repeated indoor air samples (n = 32 homes) for five phthalate diesters. Mixed-effects models were fit to evaluate reproducibility via intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of using a single specimen versus repeat samples to classify a woman's exposure in the low or high category. Results Phthalates were detected in 85\textendash 100\% of air and urine samples. ICCs for the unadjusted urinary metabolite concentrations ranged from 0.30 for mono-ethyl phthalate to 0.66 for monobenzyl phthalate. For indoor air, ICCs ranged from 0.48 [di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)] to 0.83 [butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP)]. Air levels of phthalate diesters correlated with their respective urinary metabolite concentrations for BBzP (r = 0.71), di-isobutyl phthalate (r = 0.44), and diethyl phthalate (DEP; r = 0.39). In women sampled late in pregnancy, specific gravity appeared to be more effective than creatinine in adjusting for urine dilution. Conclusions Urinary concentrations of DEP and DEHP metabolites in pregnant women showed lower reproducibility than metabolites for di-n-butyl phthalate and BBzP. A single indoor air sample may be sufficient to characterize phthalate exposure in the home, whereas urinary phthalate biomarkers should be sampled longitudinally during pregnancy to minimize exposure misclassification.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal urinary concentrations of phthalates in women participants in an urban birth cohort were associated with outcomes in their children related to neurodevelopment, autoimmune disease risk, and fat mass at 3,5,7, and 8~years of life. Placental biomarkers and outcomes at birth may offer biologic insight into these associations. This is the first study to address these associations with candidate genes from the phthalate and placenta literature, accounting for sex differences, and using absolute quantitation methods for mRNA levels. METHODS: We measured candidate mRNAs in 180 placentas sampled at birth (HSD17B1, AHR, CGA, CYP19A1, SLC27A4, PTGS2, PPARG, CYP11A1) by quantitative PCR and an absolute standard curve. We estimated associations of loge mRNA with quartiles of urinary phthalate monoesters using linear mixed models. Phthalate metabolites (N\,=\,358) and mRNAs (N\,=\,180) were transformed to a z-score and modeled as independent, correlated vectors in relation to large for gestational age (LGA) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). RESULTS: CGA was associated with 4 out of 6 urinary phthalates. CGA was 2.0 loge units lower at the 3rd vs. 1st quartile of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) (95\% confidence interval (CI): -3.5, -0.5) in male placentas, but 0.6 loge units higher (95\% CI: -0.8, 1.9) in female placentas (sex interaction p\,=\,0.01). There was an inverse association of MnBP with PPARG in male placentas (-1.1 loge units at highest vs. lowest quartile, 95\% CI: -2.0, -0.1). CY19A1, CYP11A1, CGA were associated with one or more of the following in a sex-specific manner: monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), MnBP, mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP). These 3 mRNAs were lower by 1.4-fold (95\% CI: -2.4, -1.0) in male GDM placentas vs. female and non-GDM placentas (p-value for interaction\,=\,0.04). The metabolites MnBP/MiBP were 16\% higher (95\% CI: 0, 22) in GDM pregnancies. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal concentrations of certain phthalates and outcomes at birth were modestly associated with molecular changes in fetal placental tissue during pregnancy. Associations were stronger in male vs. female placentas, and associations with MnBP and MiBP were stronger than other metabolites. Placental mRNAs are being pursued further as potential mediators of exposure-induced risks to the health of the child.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The exposome constitutes a promising framework to improve understanding of the effects of environmental exposures on health by explicitly considering multiple testing and avoiding selective reporting. However, exposome studies are challenged by the simultaneous consideration of many correlated exposures. OBJECTIVES: We compared the performances of linear regression-based statistical methods in assessing exposome-health associations. METHODS: In a simulation study, we generated 237 exposure covariates with a realistic correlation structure and with a health outcome linearly related to 0 to 25 of these covariates. Statistical methods were compared primarily in terms of false discovery proportion (FDP) and sensitivity. RESULTS: On average over all simulation settings, the elastic net and sparse partial least-squares regression showed a sensitivity of 76\% and an FDP of 44\%; Graphical Unit Evolutionary Stochastic Search (GUESS) and the deletion/substitution/addition (DSA) algorithm revealed a sensitivity of 81\% and an FDP of 34\%. The environment-wide association study (EWAS) underperformed these methods in terms of FDP (average FDP, 86\%) despite a higher sensitivity. Performances decreased considerably when assuming an exposome exposure matrix with high levels of correlation between covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between exposures is a challenge for exposome research, and the statistical methods investigated in this study were limited in their ability to efficiently differentiate true predictors from correlated covariates in a realistic exposome context. Although GUESS and DSA provided a marginally better balance between sensitivity and FDP, they did not outperform the other multivariate methods across all scenarios and properties examined, and computational complexity and flexibility should also be considered when choosing between these methods.

  abstract = {Introduction Phenols and parabens are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Evidence from animal studies and limited human data suggest they may be endocrine disruptors. In the current study, we examined associations of phenols and parabens with reproductive and thyroid hormones in 106 pregnant women recruited for the prospective cohort, ``Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT)''. Methods Urinary exposure biomarkers (bisphenol A, triclosan, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol, butyl, methyl and propyl paraben) and serum hormone levels (estradiol, progesterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid stimulating hormone) were measured at up to two time points during pregnancy (16\textendash 20 weeks and 24\textendash 28 weeks). We used linear mixed models to assess relationships between exposure biomarkers and hormone levels across pregnancy, controlling for urinary specific gravity, maternal age, BMI and education. In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated cross-sectional relationships between exposure and hormone levels stratified by study visit using linear regression. Results An IQR increase in methyl paraben was associated with a 7.70\% increase (95\% CI 1.50, 13.90) in SHBG. Furthermore, an IQR increase in butyl paraben as associated with an 8.46\% decrease (95\% CI 16.92, 0.00) in estradiol, as well as a 9.34\% decrease (95\% CI -18.31,-0.38) in estradiol/progesterone. Conversely, an IQR increase in butyl paraben was associated with a 5.64\% increase (95\% CI 1.26, 10.02) in FT4. Progesterone was consistently negatively associated with phenols, but none reached statistical significance. After stratification, methyl and propyl paraben were suggestively negatively associated with estradiol at the first time point (16\textendash 20 weeks), and suggestively positively associated with estradiol at the second time point (24\textendash 28 weeks). Conclusions Within this ongoing birth cohort, certain phenols and parabens were associated with altered reproductive and thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy. These changes may contribute to adverse health effects in mothers or their offspring, but additional research is required.},

  abstract = {Background: A number of phenols and parabens are added to consumer products for a variety of functions, and have been found at detectable levels in the majority of the U.S. population. Among other functions, thyroid hormones are essential in fetal neurodevelopment, and could be impacted by the endocrine disrupting effects of phenols and parabens. The present study investigated the association between ten maternal urinary phenol and paraben biomarkers (bisphenol S, triclosan, triclocarban, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol, and ethyl, butyl, methyl and propyl paraben) and four plasma thyroid hormones in 439 pregnant women in a case\textendash control sample nested within a cohort study based in Boston, MA. Methods: Urine and blood samples were collected from up to four visits during pregnancy (median weeks of gestation at each visit: Visit 1: 9.64, Visit 2: 17.9, Visit 3: 26.0, Visit 4: 35.1). Linear mixed models were constructed to take into account the repeated measures jointly, followed by multivariate linear regression models stratified by gestational age to explore potential windows of susceptibility. Results: We observed decreased total triiodothyronine (T3) in relation to an IQR increase in benzophenone-3 (percent change [\%{$\Delta$}] = -2.07; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = -4.16, 0.01), butyl paraben (\%{$\Delta$} = -2.76; 95\% CI = -5.25, -0.26) and triclosan (\%{$\Delta$} = -2.53; 95\% CI = -4.75, -0.30), and triclocarban at levels above the LOD (\%{$\Delta$} = -5.71; 95\% CI = -10.45, -0.97). A 2.41\% increase in T3 was associated with an IQR increase in methyl paraben (95\% CI = 0.58, 4.24). We also detected a negative association between free thyroxine (FT4) and propyl paraben (\%{$\Delta$} = -3.14; 95\% CI = -6.12, -0.06), and a suggestive positive association between total thyroxine (T4) and methyl paraben (\%{$\Delta$} = 1.19; 95\% CI = -0.10, 2.47). Gestational age-specific multivariate regression analyses showed that the magnitude and direction of some of the observed associations were dependent on the timing of exposure. Conclusion: Certain phenols and parabens were associated with altered thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy, and the timing of exposure influenced the association between phenol and paraben, and hormone concentrations. These changes may contribute to downstream maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additional research is required to replicate the associations, and determine the potential biological mechanisms underlying the observed associations.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and to effects on epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, at genes involved in brain function. High doses of BPA have been shown to change expression and regulation of one such gene, Grin2b, in mice. Yet, if such changes occur at relevant doses in animals and humans has not been addressed. We investigated if low-dose developmental BPA exposure affects DNA methylation and expression of Grin2b in brains of adult rats. Furthermore, we assessed associations between prenatal BPA exposure and Grin2b methylation in 7-year old children. We found that Grin2b mRNA expression was increased and DNA methylation decreased in female, but not in male rats. In humans, prenatal BPA exposure was associated with increased methylation levels in girls. Additionally, low APGAR scores, a predictor for increased risk for neurodevelopmental diseases, were associated with higher Grin2b methylation levels in girls. Thus, we could link developmental BPA exposure and low APGAR scores to changes in the epigenetic regulation of Grin2b, a gene important for neuronal function, in a sexual dimorphic fashion. Discrepancies in exact locations and directions of the DNA methylation change might reflect differences between species, analysed tissues, exposure level and/or timing.},

Extracellular activation of the latent TGF-{$\beta$} complex is a crucial step in the regulation of TGF-{$\beta$} function for tissue homeostasis. We show that the fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain of the matrix glycoprotein tenascin-X (TNX) interacts physically with the small latent TGF-{$\beta$} complex in vitro and in vivo, thus regulating the bioavailability of mature TGF-{$\beta$} to cells by activating the latent cytokine into an active molecule. Activation by the FBG domain most likely occurs through a conformational change in the latent complex and involves a novel cell adhesion\textendash dependent mechanism.

There are many approaches to answering this question, but they generally fall into two categories: measures of predictive power (like R-square) and goodness of fit tests (like the Pearson chi-square). This presentation looks first at R-square measures, arguing that the optional R-squares reported by PROC LOGISTIC might not be optimal. Measures proposed by McFadden and Tjur appear to be more attractive. As for goodness of fit, the popular Hosmer and Lemeshow test is shown to have some serious problems.

Triclosan has previously been found in human plasma and milk, but neither the primary source of human exposure nor the efficiency of triclosan transfer to human milk is known. In this study, plasma and milk were sampled from 36 mothers and analyzed for triclosan. Scrutinization of the women's personal care products revealed that nine of the mothers used toothpaste, deodorant or soap containing triclosan. Triclosan and/or its metabolites were omnipresent in the analyzed plasma and milk. The concentrations were higher in both plasma and milk from the mothers who used personal care products containing triclosan than in the mothers who did not. This demonstrated that personal care products containing triclosan were the dominant, but not the only, source of systemic exposure to triclosan. The concentrations were significantly higher in plasma than in milk, indicating that infant exposure to triclosan via breast milk is much less than the dose in the mother.},

Several studies have reported on the transfer of this compound to food. Regarding human exposure to BPA, food intake can be considered the most serious among all the routes, not only because it potentially reaches more people in different age groups (including infants, an especially vulnerable group), but also because it inadvertently occurs over long time periods. BPA is considered an endocrine disruptor and several studies have proposed a relationship between exposure to BPA and the appearance of adverse health effects, such as cancer, infertility, diabetes, and obesity, among others. In 2015 however, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its last scientific opinion that this compound does not pose any risk to the exposed population's health. Therefore, the EU regards BPA as an authorized product to be used as food contact material. Although BPA intake through food is apparently below the set limits, research into BPA and its potential negative effects is still ongoing. This review contains the most recent in vitro and in vivo studies on BPA toxicity and its harmful effects on health, and it intends to address human exposure to BPA, namely through dietary exposure and its impact on human health.},

However, large genetic association studies can only explain a fraction of the observed variability and striking secular trends suggest that lifestyle and/or environmental factors are important. Using liquid-chromatography tandem-mass-spectrometry, we measured endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs; triclosan, bisphenol A, benzophenone-3, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 11 metabolites from 5 phthalates) in longitudinal urine samples obtained biannually from peri-pubertal children included in the COPENHAGEN puberty cohort. EDC levels were associated with blood DNA methylation profiles from 31 boys and 20 girls measured both pre- and post-pubertally. We found little evidence of single methylation sites that on their own showed association with urinary excretion levels of EDCs obtained either the same-day or measured as the yearly mean of dichotomized EDC levels. In contrast, methylation of several promoter regions was found to be associated with two or more EDCs, overlap with known gene-chemical interactions, and form a core network with genes known to be important for puberty. Furthermore, children with the highest yearly mean of dichotomized urinary phthalate metabolite levels were associated with higher promoter methylation of the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 gene (TRIP6), which again was mirrored by lower circulating TRIP6 protein levels. In general, the mean TRIP6 promoter methylation was mirrored by circulating TRIP6 protein levels. Our results provide a potential molecular mode of action of how exposure to environmental chemicals may modify pubertal development.},

Our aim was to analyze whether BPA or BP3 direct exposure affects the functional differentiation of the mammary gland using an in vitro model. Mammary organoids were obtained and isolated from 8 week-old virgin female C57BL/6 mice and were differentiated on Matrigel with medium containing lactogenic hormones and exposed to: a) vehicle (0.01\% ethanol); b) 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M or 1~\texttimes ~10-6~M BPA; or c) 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M, 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M or 1~\texttimes ~10-6~M BP3 for 72~h. The mRNA and protein expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PR) were assessed. In addition, mRNA levels of PR-B isoform, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), prolactin receptor (PRLR) and Stat5a, and protein expression of pStat5a/b were evaluated at 72~h. The mRNA and protein expression of milk proteins and their DNA methylation status were also analyzed. Although mRNA level of PRLR and GR was similar between treatments, mRNA expression of ESR1, total PR, PR-B and Stat5a was increased in organoids exposed to 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA and 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3. Total PR expression was also increased with 1~\texttimes ~10-6~M BPA. Nuclear ESR1 and PR expression was observed in all treated organoids; whereas nuclear pStat5a/b alveolar cells was observed only in organoids exposed to 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA and 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3. The beta-casein mRNA level was increased in both BPA concentrations and 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3, which was associated with hypomethylation of its promoter. The beta-casein protein expression was only increased with 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA or 1~\texttimes ~10-12~M BP3. In contrast, BPA exposure decreased alpha-lactalbumin mRNA expression and increased DNA methylation level in different methylation-sensitive sites of the gene. Also, 1~\texttimes ~10-9~M BPA decreased alpha-lactalbumin protein expression. Our results demonstrate that BPA or BP3 exposure alters milk protein synthesis and its transcriptional regulation during mammary gland differentiation in vitro.},

Epidemiological studies have postulated the hypothesis of the fetal origin of disease, which is mediated by epigenetic changes. Epigenetic marks are inheritable; they modulate the gene expression and can affect human health due to the presence of environmental factors. OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on DNA-methylation and its association with environmental-related diseases in children. METHODS: A search for studies related to DNA-methylation in children by pre- or post-natal environmental exposures was conducted, and those studies with appropriate designs and statistical analyses and evaluations of the exposure were selected. FINDINGS: Prenatal and early life environmental factors, from diet to exposure to pollutants, have been associated with epigenetic changes, specifically DNA-methylation. Thus, maternal nutrition and smoking and exposure to air particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and some endocrine disrupters during pregnancy have been associated with genomic and gene-specific newborns' DNA-methylation changes that have shown in some cases sex-specific patterns. In addition, these maternal factors may deregulate the placental DNA-methylation balance and could induce a fetal reprogramming and later-in-life diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to environmental pollutants during prenatal and early life can trigger epigenetic imbalances and eventually the development of diseases in children. The integration of epigenetic data should be considered in future risk assessments.},

  abstract = {Paracetamol has a central analgesic effect that is mediated through activation of descending serotonergic pathways. Debate exists about its primary site of action, which may be inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis or through an active metabolite influencing cannabinoid receptors. Prostaglandin H2 synthetase (PGHS) is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of arachidonic acid to the unstable PGH2. The two major forms of this enzyme are the constitutive PGHS-1 and the inducible PGHS-2. PGHS comprises of two sites: a cyclooxygenase (COX) site and a peroxidase (POX) site. The conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 is dependent on a tyrosine-385 radical at the COX site. Formation of a ferryl protoporphyrin IX radical cation from the reducing agent Fe3+ at the POX site is essential for conversion of tyrosine-385 to its radical form. Paracetamol acts as a reducing cosubstrate on the POX site and lessens availability of the ferryl protoporphyrin IX radical cation. This effect can be reduced in the presence of hydroperoxide-generating lipoxygenase enzymes within the cell (peroxide tone) or by swamping the POX site with substrate such as PGG2. Peroxide tone and swamping explain lack of peripheral analgesic effect, platelet effect, and anti-inflammatory effect by paracetamol. Alternatively, paracetamol effects may be mediated by an active metabolite (p-aminophenol). p-Aminophenol is conjugated with arachidonic acid by fatty acid amide hydrolase to form AM404. AM404 exerts effect through cannabinoid receptors. It may also work through PGHS, particularly in areas of the brain with high concentrations of fatty acid amide hydrolase.},

One such exposure, bisphenol A (BPA), has been associated with obesity and diabetes, and consequently labeled an obesogen. Using an isogenic murine model, we examined the effects of perinatal exposure through maternal diet to 50 ng (n=20), 50 {$\mu$}g (n=21), or 50 mg (n=18) BPA/kg diet, as well as controls (n=20) on offspring energy expenditure, spontaneous activity, and body composition at 3, 6, and 9 mo of age, and hormone levels at 9 and 10 mo of age. Overall, exposed females and males exhibited increased energy expenditure (P{$<$}0.001 and 0.001, respectively) throughout the life course. In females, horizontal and vertical activity increased (P=0.07 and 0.06, respectively) throughout the life course. Generally, body composition measures were not different throughout the life course in exposed females or males (all P{$>$}0.44), although body fat and weight decreased in exposed females at particular ages (all P{$<$}0.08). Milligram-exposed females had improved glucose, insulin, adiponectin, and leptin profiles (all P{$<$}0.10). Thus, life-course analysis illustrates that BPA is associated with hyperactive and lean phenotypes. Variability across studies may be attributable to differential exposure duration and timing, dietary fat and phytoestrogen content, or lack of sophisticated phenotyping across the life course.\textemdash Anderson, O.S., Peterson, K.E., Sanchez, B.N., Zhang, Z., Mancuso, P., Dolinoy, D.C.

The lack of reliable methods for early detection limits the opportunities for prevention, diagnosis, and timely treatment. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore distinct DNA methylation patterns associated with preeclampsia in both maternal cells and fetal-derived tissue that represent potential biomarkers to predict future preeclampsia and inheritance in children. METHOD: A convenience sample of nulliparous women (N = 55) in the first trimester of pregnancy was recruited for this prospective study. Genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified in first-trimester maternal peripheral white blood cells and placental chorionic tissue from normotensive women and those with preeclampsia (n = 6/group). RESULTS: Late-onset preeclampsia developed in 12.7\% of women. Significant differences in DNA methylation were identified in 207 individual linked cytosine and guanine (CpG) sites in maternal white blood cells collected in the first trimester (132 sites with gain and 75 sites with loss of methylation), which were common to approximately 75\% of the differentially methylated CpG sites identified in chorionic tissue of fetal origin. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to identify maternal epigenetic targets and common targets in fetal-derived tissue that represent putative biomarkers for early detection and heritable risk of preeclampsia. Findings may pave the way for diagnosis of preeclampsia prior to its clinical presentation and acute damaging effects, and the potential for prevention of the detrimental long-term sequelae.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic gene regulatory mechanism; disruption of this process during early embryonic development can have major consequences on both fetal and placental development. The periconceptional period and intrauterine life are crucial for determining long-term susceptibility to diseases. Treatments and procedures in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and adverse in-utero environments may modify the methylation levels of genomic imprinting regions, including insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)/H19, mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST), and paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10), affecting the development of the fetus. ART, maternal psychological stress, and gestational exposures to chemicals are common stressors suspected to alter global epigenetic patterns including imprinted genes. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Our objective is to highlight the effect of conception mode and maternal psychological stress on fetal development. Specifically, we monitor fetal programming, regulation of imprinted genes, fetal growth, and long-term disease risk, using the imprinted genes IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 as examples. The possible role of environmental chemicals in genomic imprinting is also discussed. SEARCH METHODS: A PubMed search of articles published mostly from 2005 to 2019 was conducted using search terms IGF2/H19, MEST, PEG10, imprinted genes, DNA methylation, gene expression, and imprinting disorders (IDs). Studies focusing on maternal prenatal stress, psychological well-being, environmental chemicals, ART, and placental/fetal development were evaluated and included in this review. OUTCOMES: IGF2/H19, MEST, and PEG10 imprinted genes have a broad developmental effect on fetal growth and birth weight variation. Their disruption is linked to pregnancy complications, metabolic disorders, cognitive impairment, and cancer. Adverse early environment has a major impact on the developing fetus, affecting mostly growth, the structure, and subsequent function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neurodevelopment. Extensive evidence suggests that the gestational environment has an impact on epigenetic patterns including imprinting, which can lead to adverse long-term outcomes in the offspring. Environmental stressors such as maternal prenatal psychological stress have been found to associate with altered DNA methylation patterns in placenta and to affect fetal development. Studies conducted during the past decades have suggested that ART pregnancies are at a higher risk for a number of complications such as birth defects and IDs. ART procedures involve multiple steps that are conducted during critical windows for imprinting establishment and maintenance, necessitating long-term evaluation of children conceived through ART. Exposure to environmental chemicals can affect placental imprinting and fetal growth both in humans and in experimental animals. Therefore, their role in imprinting should be better elucidated, considering the ubiquitous exposure to these chemicals. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Dysregulation of imprinted genes is a plausible mechanism linking stressors such as maternal psychological stress, conception using ART, and chemical exposures with fetal growth. It is expected that a greater understanding of the role of imprinted genes and their regulation in fetal development will provide insights for clinical prevention and management of growth and IDs. In a broader context, evidence connecting impaired imprinted gene function to common diseases such as cancer is increasing. This implies early regulation of imprinting may enable control of long-term human health, reducing the burden of disease in the population in years to come.},

In the healthy lung, several physiologic and metabolic factors exhibit disparity when comparing the upper lobe of the lung to lower lobe, including differences in oxygenation, ventilation, lymphatic flow, pH, and blood flow. In this study, we asked whether these regional differences in the lung are associated with DNA methylation changes in lung macrophages that could potentially lead to altered cell responsiveness upon subsequent environmental challenge. All analyses were performed using primary lung macrophages collected via bronchoalveolar lavage from healthy human subjects with normal pulmonary function. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was examined via Infinium MethylationEPIC (850K) array and validated by targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing. We observed 95 CpG loci with significant differential methylation in lung macrophages, comparing upper lobe to lower lobe (all false discovery rate , 0.05). Several of these genes, including CLIP4, HSH2D, NR4A1, SNX10, and TYK2, have been implicated as participants in inflammatory/immune-related biological processes. Functionally, we identified phenotypic differences in oxygen use, comparing upper versus lower lung macrophages. Our results support a hypothesis that epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation, at a multitude of gene loci in lung macrophages are associated with metabolic differences regionally in lung.

The cut-off points used to discriminate smoking status were the level of UC given by Youden's index and for 50 and 100 ng/ml for daily smokers, or 25 and 50 ng/ml for occasional smokers. Participants At the third trimester of pregnancy, 2263 pregnant women of the INMA Project were interviewed between 2004 and 2008 and a urine sample was collected. Results Prevalence of self-reported smokers at the third trimester of pregnancy was 18.5\%, and another 3.9\% misreported their smoking status. Variables associated with self-reported smoking and misreporting were similar, including born in Europe, educational level and exposure to SHS. The optimal cut-off was 82 ng/ml (95\% CI 42 to 133), sensitivity 95.2\% and specificity 96.6\%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.986 (95\% CI 0.982 to 0.990). The cut-offs varied according to the SHS exposure level being 42 (95\% CI 27 to 57), 82 (95\% CI 46 to 136) and 106 ng/ml (95\% CI 58 to 227) for not being SHS exposed, exposed to one, and to two or more sources of SHS, respectively. The optimal cut-off for discriminating occasional smokers from non-smokers was 27 ng/ml (95\% CI 11 to 43). Conclusions Prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Spain remains high. UC is a reliable biomarker for classifying pregnant women according to their smoking status. However, cut-offs would differ based on baseline exposure to SHS.},

However, the biomonitoring of direct exposure reflection for fetuses are rare. In this study, we determine the concentrations of TCS and TCC in paired maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine, and amniotic fluid samples collected from a cohort of 95 expecting mother-fetal pairs in Southern China. TCS and TCC are detected widely (detection rates: {$>$}76.9\%) in maternal serum, cord serum, maternal urine, and amniotic fluid samples. TCS is found to be the predominant antimicrobial agent with median concentrations in maternal serum (1.5~ng/mL) and cord serum (1.8~ng/mL) that are one order of magnitude higher than those of tcc in maternal serum (0.085~ng/mL) and cord serum (0.052~ng/mL), respectively. Cord serum concentrations of tcs and tcc correlated well with the concentrations in maternal serum, which reflect the mothers' contribution to fetal exposure. The higher median ratio of cord serum/maternal serumTCS (0.95) compared to that of cord serum/maternal serumTCC (0.53) indicates high placental transmission ability of TCS. Moreover, the facility to penetrate the placental barrier and hard to depurate characteristics lead to the long residence of TCS in the fetal environment, causing great concern over the prenatal exposure risks during the critical window of fetal development. This study provides a novel contribution by increasing existing knowledge on the exposure assessment of TCS and TCC during pregnancy through the exploration of matched maternal-fetal samples.},

  abstract = {Background Parabens, which are used as a preservative in foods and personal care products, are detected in nearly 100\% of human urine samples. Exposure to parabens is associated with DNA damage, male infertility, and endocrine disruption in adults, but the effects of prenatal exposure are unclear. In part, this is due to inadequate assessment of exposure in maternal urine, which may only reflect maternal rather than fetal exposure. To address this gap, we examined the association of prenatal methylparaben measured in meconium with preterm birth, gestational age, birthweight, maternal thyroid hormones, and child Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) at 6\textendash 7~years. Design Data come from the GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) prospective observational pregnancy cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. Participants were 345 children with data on ADHD among 394 eligible pregnancies in women age {$\geq$}18~years with no known thyroid disease before pregnancy and meconium collected at delivery. Methylparaben was measured in meconium. Birthweight, gestational age, and maternal thyroid hormones at {$<$}20~weeks gestation were measured at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke. Preterm birth was defined as vaginal birth before the 37th week of gestation. Physician diagnosis of ADHD was determined at a scheduled cohort follow-up when children were 6\textendash 7~years old or from medical records. Associations between meconium methylparaben and outcomes were estimated with logistic and linear regressions weighted on the inverse probability of exposure to account for potential confounders, including child sex, familial income, maternal education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, age, and smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Results Methylparaben was detected in 65 meconium samples (19\%), 33 children were diagnosed with ADHD (10\%), and 13 children were born preterm (4\%). Meconium methylparaben was associated with preterm birth (odds ratio [OR]~=~4.81; 95\% CI [2.29, 10.10]), decreased gestational age (beta [{$\beta$}]~=~-0.61~weeks; 95\% CI [-0.93, -0.29]) and birthweight ({$\beta~$}=~-0.12~kg; 95\% CI [-0.21, -0.03]), altered maternal TSH (relative concentration [RC]~=~0.76; 95\% CI [0.58, 0.99]), total T3 (RC~=~0.84; 95\% CI [0.75, 0.96]) and total T4 (RC~=~1.10; 95\% CI [1.01, 1.19]), maternal hypothyroxinemia (OR~=~2.50, 95\% CI [1.01, 6.22]), and child ADHD at age of 6\textendash 7 (OR~=~2.33, 95\% CI [1.45, 3.76]). The effect of meconium methylparaben on ADHD was partially mediated by preterm birth (20\% mediation) and birthweight (13\% mediation). Conclusions Meconium methylparaben was associated with preterm birth, decreased gestational age and birthweight, maternal thyroid hormone dysfunction, and child ADHD. Parabens are a substantial health concern if causally related to these adverse outcomes.},

HSPs are overexpressed in cancer cells and play roles in their apoptosis, invasion, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The regulation or translational modification of HSPs is recognized as a therapeutic target for the development of anticancer drugs. Among the regulatory processes associated with HSP expression, the epigenetic machinery (miRNAs, histone modification, and DNA methylation) has key functions in cancer. Moreover, various epigenetic modifiers of HSP expression have also been reported as therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers of cancer. Thus, in this review, we describe the epigenetic alterations of HSP expression in cancer cells and suggest that HSPs be clinically applied as diagnostic and therapeutic markers in cancer therapy via controlled epigenetic modifiers.},

Objective The objective of this study was to describe these parameters in a well-characterised, prospective birth cohort. Methods Data were drawn from the MotherToBaby study of pregnant women enrolled from 2004 to 2018. Daily acetaminophen diaries were calculated for all exposed women with complete dose and duration information. Descriptive statistics were used to assess maternal characteristics associated with acetaminophen use. Prevalence by 2-year interval was described, and linear regression was used to test for trend. Indication of use and dose per indication were summarised. Results Of 2441 subjects, 1515 (62\%) reported use of acetaminophen. Over the 15-year period, there was a decline in use of 2.5\% for each 2-year period (test for trend = 0.001) with 58\% reporting acetaminophen use in 2017-2018. Among women with acetaminophen use in pregnancy (n = 1515), 58\% reported {$<$}10 days of use, 13\% reported 10-19 days of use, 9\% reported 20-44 days of use, and 9\% reported 45 or more days of use. Twelve per cent had undefined duration of use. Increasing duration of exposure was associated with tobacco use, obesity, self-reported depression or anxiety, and antidepressant use. The most frequently reported indication was headache, however, indication varied by duration of use, with more women reporting use for sleep or pain/injury in the categories with the longest duration of use. Median dose per exposed day was highest among those reporting use for sleep, and higher doses were more frequently reported for arthritis, injury, and pain. Conclusion Acetaminophen is used by the majority of pregnant women, and some continue to use for many weeks in pregnancy. Given the heterogeneity in duration of use, indication, and dose, studies that estimate the risk of adverse outcomes associated with acetaminophen must carefully consider these factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The deleterious biological effects of low-level, long-term exposure to heavy metals are well known, and children are the most susceptible population. Dabaoshan Mine in the southeast of Guangdong Province is at high risk of discharging multi-metals pollutants into a local river (Hengshihe) and the surrounding area. The present study aimed to estimate relationships between measured multi-metal exposures and the presence of behavioural problems for the school-aged children in the polluted area. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. Children aged 7-16 years living in three villages of the Hengshihe area with different degrees of heavy-metal pollution participated in this study. Local environmental samples (water and crops) and children's hair were collected, and concentrations of heavy metals were determined. The Child Behaviour Check-list (CBCL) was used to assess the presence of behaviour problems. General linear regression was used to analyze the contribution of hair metals to each CBCL subscale with adjustment for socio-demographic confounding factors. RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses revealed significant effects of hair lead, cadmium and zinc levels on CBCL subscales. Log-transformed hair lead, cadmium and zinc levels accounted for an incremental of 8\% to 15\% variance in anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour. The concurrent log-transformed hair lead and zinc levels were strongly associated with all subscales while the concurrent log-transformed hair cadmium was only significantly associated with withdrawn, social problems and attention problems. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that heavy metal exposure was associated with increased risk of behavioral problems for school-aged children.},

  abstract = {Objective A systematic review and a meta-analysis were carried out in order to summarize the current published studies and to evaluate LINE-1 hypomethylation in blood and other tissues as an epigenetic marker for cancer risk. Methods A systematic literature search in the Medline database, using PubMed, was conducted for epidemiological studies, published before March 2014. The random-effects model was used to estimate weighted mean differences (MDs) with 95\% Confidence Intervals (CIs). Furthermore, subgroup analyses were conducted by sample type (tissue or blood samples), cancer types, and by assays used to measure global DNA methylation levels. The Cochrane software package Review Manager 5.2 was used. Results A total of 19 unique articles on 6107 samples (2554 from cancer patients and 3553 control samples) were included in the meta-analysis. LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in cancer patients than in controls (MD: -6.40, 95\% CI: -7.71, -5.09; p{$<$}0.001). The significant difference in methylation levels was confirmed in tissue samples (MD -7.55; 95\% CI: -9.14, -65.95; p{$<$}0.001), but not in blood samples (MD: -0.26, 95\% CI: -0.69, 0.17; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.23). LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in colorectal and gastric cancer patients than in controls (MD: -8.33; 95\% CI: -10.56, -6.10; p{$<$}0.001 and MD: -5.75; 95\% CI: -7.75, -3.74; p{$<$}0.001) whereas, no significant difference was observed for hepatocellular cancer. Conclusions The present meta-analysis adds new evidence to the growing literature on the role of LINE-1 hypomethylation in human cancer and demonstrates that LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly lower in cancer patients than in control samples, especially in certain cancer types. This result was confirmed in tissue samples, both fresh/frozen or FFPE specimens, but not in blood. Further studies are needed to better clarify the role of LINE-1 methylation in specific subgroups, considering both cancer and sample type, and the methods of measurement.},

Generally, the relationships between environmental exposure, changes in miRNA expression, and gestational disorders are explored separately, producing conflicting findings. However, validation of tissue-accessible biomarkers for the monitoring of adverse pregnancy outcomes needs a systematic methodological approach that takes also into account early-life environmental exposure. To achieve this goal, exposure to xenochemicals, endogenous agents, and diet should be assessed.

This does not provide a secure basis for prevention of the disease. Geographical studies gave the first clue that the disease originates during intra-uterine development. Variations in mortality from the disease across England and Wales were shown to correlate closely with past differences in death rates among newborn babies. In the past most deaths among newborns were attributed to low birthweight. This led to the hypothesis that undernutrition in utero permanently changes the body's structure, function and metabolism in ways that lead to coronary heart disease in later life. The association between low birthweight and coronary heart disease has been confirmed in longitudinal studies of men and women around the world. The developmental model of the origins of the disease offers a new way forward.},

  abstract = {Background There is growing interest in examining the simultaneous effects of multiple exposures and, more generally, the effects of mixtures of exposures, as part of the exposome concept (being defined as the totality of human environmental exposures from conception onwards). Uncovering such combined effects is challenging owing to the large number of exposures, several of them being highly correlated. We performed a simulation study in an exposome context to compare the performance of several statistical methods that have been proposed to detect statistical interactions. Methods Simulations were based on an exposome including 237 exposures with a realistic correlation structure. We considered several statistical regression-based methods, including two-step Environment-Wide Association Study (EWAS2), the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Group-Lasso INTERaction-NET (GLINTERNET), a three-step method based on regression trees and finally Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). We assessed the performance of each method in terms of model size, predictive ability, sensitivity and false discovery rate. Results GLINTERNET and DSA had better overall performance than the other methods, with GLINTERNET having better properties in terms of selecting the true predictors (sensitivity) and of predictive ability, while DSA had a lower number of false positives. In terms of ability to capture interaction terms, GLINTERNET and DSA had again the best performances, with the same trade-off between sensitivity and false discovery proportion. When GLINTERNET and DSA failed to select an exposure truly associated with the outcome, they tended to select a highly correlated one. When interactions were not present in the data, using variable selection methods that allowed for interactions had only slight costs in performance compared to methods that only searched for main effects. Conclusions GLINTERNET and DSA provided better performance in detecting two-way interactions, compared to other existing methods.

However, impacts of low levels of BPA exposure on placental developmental processes such as first trimester trophoblast cell growth, angiogenesis and epigenetic modifications are not well studied. Low concentration of BPA (1\,nM) affected cell proliferation of human placental first trimester trophoblasts using a model cell, HTR8/SVneo. BPA abolished both basal- and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated tube formation in these cells. BPA significantly down regulated mRNA expression of VEGF, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 with concomitant upregulation of 11-{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 mRNA and protein expression in HTR8/SVneo cells. BPA also lowered CpG methylation of gene promoter associated with metabolic and oxidative stress. This study demonstrated that BPA at 1\,nM not only affected cellular growth, development and angiogenic activities but also affected DNA methylation of stress response and down-regulation of angiogenic growth factors in first trimester trophoblast cells.},

  abstract = {The currently estimated number of genes in the human genome is much smaller than previously predicted. As an explanation for this disparity, most individual genes have multiple transcriptional units that represent a variety of biologically important gene products. GNAS exemplifies a gene of such complexity. One of its products is the {$\alpha$}-subunit of the stimulatory heterotrimeric G protein (Gs{$\alpha$}), a ubiquitous signaling protein essential for numerous different cellular responses. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations within Gs{$\alpha$}-coding GNAS exons are found in various human disorders, including Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, pseudohypoparathyroidism, fibrous dysplasia of bone, and some tumors of different origin. While Gs{$\alpha$} expression in most tissues is biallelic, paternal Gs{$\alpha$} expression is silenced in a small number of tissues, playing an important role in the development of phenotypes associated with GNAS mutations. Additional products derived exclusively from the paternal GNAS allele include XL{$\alpha$}s, a protein partially identical to Gs{$\alpha$}, and two non-coding RNA molecules, the A/B transcript and the antisense transcript. The maternal GNAS allele leads to NESP55, a chromogranin-like neuroendocrine secretory protein. In vivo animal models have demonstrated the importance of each of the exclusively imprinted GNAS products in normal mammalian physiology. However, although one or more of these products are also disrupted by most naturally occurring GNAS mutations, their roles in disease pathogenesis remain unknown. To further our understanding of the significance of this gene in physiology and pathophysiology, it will be important to elucidate the cellular roles and the mechanisms regulating the expression of each GNAS product.},

  abstract = {Background Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders. Susceptibility is believed to be the interaction of genetic heritability and environmental factors. The synchronous rises in autism/ASD prevalence and paracetamol (acetaminophen) use, as well as biologic plausibility have led to the hypothesis that paracetamol exposure may increase autism/ASD risk. Methods To explore the relationship of antenatal paracetamol exposure to ASD, population weighted average autism prevalence rates and paracetamol usage rates were compared. To explore the relationship of early neonatal paracetamol exposure to autism/ASD, population weighted average male autism prevalence rates for all available countries and U.S. states were compared to male circumcision rates \textendash{} a procedure for which paracetamol has been widely prescribed since the mid-1990s. Prevalence studies were extracted from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Summary of Autism/ASD Prevalence Studies database. Maternal paracetamol usage and circumcision rates were identified by searches on Pub Med. Results Using all available country-level data (n\,=\,8) for the period 1984 to 2005, prenatal use of paracetamol was correlated with autism/ASD prevalence (r\,=\,0.80). For studies including boys born after 1995, there was a strong correlation between country-level (n\,=\,9) autism/ASD prevalence in males and a country's circumcision rate (r\,=\,0.98). A very similar pattern was seen among U.S. states and when comparing the 3 main racial/ethnic groups in the U.S. The country-level correlation between autism/ASD prevalence in males and paracetamol was considerably weaker before 1995 when the drug became widely used during circumcision. Conclusions This ecological analysis identified country-level correlations between indicators of prenatal and perinatal paracetamol exposure and autism/ASD. State level correlation was also identified for the indicator of perinatal paracetamol exposure and autism/ASD. Like all ecological analyses, these data cannot provide strong evidence of causality. However, biologic plausibility is provided by a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence linking paracetamol metabolism to pathways shown to be important in autism and related developmental abnormalities. Taken together, these ecological findings and mechanistic evidence suggest the need for formal study of the role of paracetamol in autism.},

  abstract = {Background The non-prescription medication paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) is currently recommended as a safe pain and fever treatment during pregnancy. However, recent studies suggest a possible association between APAP use in pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment. Objectives To conduct a review of publications reporting associations between prenatal APAP use and offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods Relevant sources were identified through a key word search of multiple databases (Medline, CINAHL, OVID and TOXNET) in September 2016. All English language observational studies of pregnancy APAP and three classes of neurodevelopmental outcomes (autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligence quotient (IQ)) were included. One reviewer (AZB) independently screened all titles and abstracts, extracted and analyzed the data. Results 64 studies were retrieved and 55 were ineligible. Nine prospective cohort studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Data pooling was not appropriate due to heterogeneity in outcomes. All included studies suggested an association between prenatal APAP exposure and the neurodevelopmental outcomes; ADHD, ASD, or lower IQ. Longer duration of APAP use was associated with increased risk. Associations were strongest for hyperactivity and attention-related outcomes. Little modification of associations by indication for use was reported. Conclusions Together, these nine studies suggest an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal APAP exposure. Further studies are urgently needed with; precise indication of use and exposure assessment of use both in utero and in early life. Given the current findings, pregnant women should be cautioned against indiscriminate use of APAP. These results have substantial public health implications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the role of aquaporins (AQPs) in the regulation of amniotic fluid (AF) volume, we determined AF volume and composition and placental and fetal membrane AQP expression throughout the second half of murine gestation. METHODS: Pregnant CD1 mice were sacrificed at e10-19 and AF volume and composition determined. Placenta and fetal membranes were screened for AQP gene expression. AQP gene expression was quantified by real-time RT PCR and protein location determined by immunohistochemistry. Changes in AF volume were correlated with AQP expression. RESULTS: Both membranes and placenta demonstrated expression of AQP1, -3, -8 and -9. Advancing gestation was associated with increased AF volume from e10 to e16, with a marked decrease in AF volume from e16 to e19. By immunohistochemistry, AQP1 was localized to placental vessels and AQP3 to trophoblast. AF volume was negatively correlated with fetal membrane AQP1 and placental AQP1 and AQP9 expression, and positively correlated with placental AQP3 expression. CONCLUSION: Changes in AQPs with advancing gestation, and their correlation with AF volume, suggest a role in mediating placental and membrane water flow and ultimately AF volume. AQP1 appears to regulate fetal membrane water flow, and AQP3 is a likely candidate for the regulation of placental water flow.},

  abstract = {The region of the amnion overlying the placenta plays an active role in fluid exchange between amniotic fluid and fetal blood perfusing the surface of the placenta, whereas little transfer occurs across the reflected amnion that contacts the membranous chorion. Because aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate rapid movement of water across cells, we hypothesized that AQP gene expression in placental amnion is higher than in reflected amnion. Furthermore, because gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is often associated with polyhydramnios, we hypothesized that amnion AQP gene expression is reduced when amniotic fluid volume is elevated. Human placental and reflected amnion were obtained at cesarean delivery and subjected to relative quantitation of AQP mRNA by real-time RT-qPCR and proteins by western immunoblot. Amnion mRNA levels of five AQPs differed by up to 400-fold (P~{$<~$}0.001), with AQP1 and AQP3 most abundant, AQP8 least and AQP9 and AQP11 intermediately expressed. Aquaporin proteins showed a similar profile. Aquaporin mRNA abundance was higher (P~{$<~$}0.001) in placental than reflected amnion, whereas protein levels were lower (P~{$<~$}0.01). In GDM pregnancies, neither AQP mRNA nor protein levels were different from normal. There was no correlation between AQP mRNA or protein levels with the amniotic fluid index in normal or GDM subjects. We conclude that there is a strong differential expression profile among individual AQPs and between regions of the amnion. These findings suggest differences in contribution of individual AQPs to water transport in the two regions of the amnion. Furthermore, AQP expression in the amnion is not altered in patients with GDM.},

Both SP-cAMP, a membrane-permeable and phosphodiesterase resistant cAMP, and forskolin, an adenylate cyclase stimulator significantly increased AQP1 mRNA expression in all cell lines after 2 h in a dose-dependent manner (P{$<$}0.05) with a parallel increase in protein expression. In the time course study, 5 microM of either SP-cAMP or forskolin significantly stimulated AQP1 mRNA expression after 2 h in HTR-8/SVneo cells and after 10 h in JAR and JEG-3 cells. AQP1 protein expression was highest after 20 h in both HTR-8/SVneo and JEG-3 cells (P{$<$}0.05). AVP-stimulated cAMP elevation was blocked in the presence of 9-(tetrahydro-2'-furyl) adenine (SQ22536) (100 microM), a cell-permeable adenylate cyclase inhibitor (P{$<$}0.05). These results indicate that in trophoblasts-like cells AQP1 gene expression is upregulated by both AVP and cAMP agonists. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that a cAMP-dependent pathway is responsible for the AVP effect on AQP1. Thus, modulation of AQP1 expression by maternal hormones may regulate invasion and fetal-placental-amnion water homeostasis during gestation.},

  abstract = {Some have questioned the importance of the small effect sizes generally reported in epidemiological studies of neurotoxicity. To some extent, this reflects a failure to appreciate the critical distinction between individual and population risk. In the first part of the paper, arguments are marshaled to support the contention that small shifts in the mean value of a health index within a study sample can, under some circumstances, carry substantial implications for the health status of the population from which the study sample was drawn. Under such circumstances, a populationbased approach to prevention might be as effective as a patient-based approach. The second part clarifies conditions under which this will be true (e.g., a monotonic relationship between a health index and risk of disease) and conditions under which it might not (e.g., a J-shaped relationship). In the third part, the relative levels of uncertainty in characterizing individual versus population risk are explored. In neurotoxicological studies, uncertainty in characterizing individual risk could be reduced by adjusting, in addition to bone fide confounders, for covariates that are strong predictors of outcome and by more assiduous efforts to characterize major effect modifiers.},

With regard to validity, the critical issues pertain to the appropriate strategy for confounder adjustment, particularly when confounders are complex, multi-faceted constructs, and to the need for greater clarity and transparency in articulating the causal relationships implicit in the analytic approach applied. With regard to precision, the critical issue is a need to identify the contributors to the substantial variability observed in the effect estimates that describe dose-response and dose-effect relationships. In addition to methodological sources, such as imprecision in estimating dose at the critical organ site(s), true inter-individual differences in susceptibility to a neurotoxicant could also contribute to the variability. Variability might be reduced by taking full account of factors such as co-exposures or health co-morbidities, genetic polymorphisms, and the social ecology of exposure. With regard to interpretation, we need to do a better job as a field conveying to risk assessors and others the ecological significance of the types of performance deficits observed following neurotoxicant exposure, emphasizing the distinction between individual and population risk. A final issue discussed is the need to define standards for the conduct, analysis, and reporting of epidemiologic studies of neurotoxicity, similar to those developed for other fields.},

  abstract = {Background: Studies of early-life neurotoxicant exposure have not been designed, analyzed, or interpreted in the context of a fully developmental perspective. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to describe the key principles of a developmental perspective and to use examples from the literature to illustrate the relevance of these principles to early-life neurotoxicant exposures. Methods: Four principles are discussed: 1) the effects of early-life neurotoxicant exposure depend on a child's developmental context; 2) deficits caused by early-life exposure initiate developmental cascades that can lead to pathologies that differ from those observed initially; 3) early-life neurotoxicant exposure has intra-familial and intergenerational impacts; 4) the impacts of early-life neurotoxicant exposure influence a child's ability to respond to future insults. The first principle is supported by considerable evidence, but the other three have received much less attention. Discussion: Incorporating a developmental perspective in studies of early-life neurotoxicant exposures requires prospective collection of data on a larger array of covariates than usually considered, using analytical approaches that acknowledge the transactional processes between a child and the environment and the phenomenon of developmental cascades. Conclusion: Consideration of early-life neurotoxicant exposure within a developmental perspective reveals that many issues remain to be explicated if we are to achieve a deep understanding of the societal health burden associated with early-life neurotoxicant exposures.},

Although human and animal studies suggest an association between exposure to phenols and parabens and thyroid hormone levels, few studies have investigated the association of in utero exposure to these chemicals and thyroid hormones in pregnant women and their neonates. We measured four environmental phenols (triclosan, benzophenone-3, and 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenol), and three parabens (methyl-, propyl-, and butyl paraben) in urine collected from mothers at two time points during pregnancy as part of the CHAMACOS (Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas) study. We measured free thyroxine (T4), total T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in serum of the pregnant women (N = 454) and TSH in their neonates (N = 365). We examined potential confounding by a large number of additional chemical exposures and used Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to select the most influential chemicals to include in regression models. We observed negative associations of prenatal urinary concentrations of propyl paraben and maternal TSH ({$\beta$} for two-fold increase = -3.26\%, 95\% CI: -5.55, -0.90) and negative associations of 2,4-dichlorophenol and maternal free T4 ({$\beta$} for two-fold increase = -0.05, 95\% CI: -0.08, -0.02), after controlling for other chemical exposures. We observed negative associations of triclosan with maternal total T4 after controlling for demographic variables, but this association became non-significant after controlling for other chemicals ({$\beta$} for two-fold increase = -0.05, 95\% CI: -0.11, 0.00). We found evidence that environmental phenols and parabens are associated with lower TSH and free T4 in pregnant women after controlling for related chemical exposures.},

  abstract = {Through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small regulatory RNAs the epigenome systematically controls gene expression during development-- both in utero and throughout life. The epigenome is also a very reactionary system; its labile nature allows it to sense and respond to environmental perturbations to ensure survival during fetal growth. This pliability can lead to aberrant epigenetic modifications that persist into later life and induce numerous disease states. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous chemicals that interfere with growth and development. Several EDCs also interfere with epigenetic programming. The investigation of the epigenotoxic effects of bisphenol A (BPA), an EDC used in the production of plastics and resins, has further raised concern for the impact of EDCs on the epigenome. Using the Agouti viable yellow (Avy) mouse model, dietary BPA exposure was shown to hypomethylate both the Avy and the CabpIAP metastable epialleles. This hypomethylating effect was counteracted with dietary supplementation of methyl donors or genistein. These results are consistent with reports of BPA and other EDCs causing epigenetic effects. Epigenotoxicity could lead to numerous developmental, metabolic, and behavioral disorders in exposed populations. The heritable nature of epigenetic changes also increases the risk for transgenerational inheritance of phenotypes. Thus, epigenotoxicity must be considered when assessing these compounds for safety.},

Although a large amount of research has been devoted to estimation and inference for data with censored responses, very little research has focused on proper statistical procedures when predictors are censored. In this paper, we consider statistical methods for dealing with multiple predictors subject to detection limits within the context of generalized linear models. We investigate and adapt several conventional methods and develop a new multiple imputation approach for analyzing data sets with predictors censored due to detection limits. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed multiple imputation estimator and suggest a computationally simple and consistent variance estimator. We also demonstrate that the conditional mean imputation method often leads to inconsistent estimates in generalized linear models, while several other methods are either computationally intensive or lead to parameter estimates that are biased or more variable compared to the proposed multiple imputation estimator. In an extensive simulation study, we assess the bias and variability of different approaches within the context of a logistic regression model and compare variance estimation methods for the proposed multiple imputation estimator. Lastly, we apply several methods to analyze the data set from a recently-conducted GenIMS study.},

All disease-causing point mutations identified until now in SYNGAP1 are truncating, raising the possibility of an association between this type of mutations and NSID. Here, we report the identification of the first pathogenic missense mutations (c.1084T{$>$}C [p.W362R], c.1685C{$>$}T [p.P562L]) and three novel truncating mutations (c.283dupC [p.H95PfsX5], c.2212\_2213del [p.S738X], and (c.2184del [p.N729TfsX31]) in SYNGAP1 in patients with NSID. A subset of these patients also showed ataxia, autism, and a specific form of generalized epilepsy that can be refractory to treatment. All of these mutations occurred de novo, except c.283dupC, which was inherited from a father who is a mosaic. Biolistic transfection of wild-type SYNGAP1 in pyramidal cells from cortical organotypic cultures significantly reduced activity-dependent phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) levels. In contrast, constructs expressing p.W362R, p.P562L, or the previously described p.R579X had no significant effect on pERK levels. These experiments suggest that the de novo missense mutations, p.R579X, and possibly all the other truncating mutations in SYNGAP1 result in a loss of its function. Moreover, our study confirms the involvement of SYNGAP1 in autism while providing novel insight into the epileptic manifestations associated with its disruption.},

OBJECTIVE: Estimate associations of prenatal and early-life exposure to acetaminophen in early childhood with cognitive, motor, and language skills in two birth cohorts. METHODS: The American Project Viva cohort (1217 mother-child pairs enrolled 1999-2002) assessed cognition at approximately 3~years using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test and the Wide Range Achievement of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA). The Brazilian 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort (3818 mother-child pairs) assessed cognition at 2~years using the INTERGROWTH-21st Neurodevelopment Assessment. We used linear regression to estimate associations of acetaminophen use during pregnancy (Project Viva and Pelotas) and infancy (Project Viva) with children's cognitive scores adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, education, parity, race/ethnicity, smoking and alcohol use during pregnancy, depression during pregnancy, antibiotic and ibuprofen use during pregnancy, household income, and child's sex. RESULTS: In Project Viva, exposure to acetaminophen in both the 1st and 2nd trimester of pregnancy was associated with lower WRAVMA drawing scores ({$\beta$} -1.51, 95\% CI -2.92, -0.10). However, in Pelotas, exposure to acetaminophen in both the 1st and 2nd trimester of pregnancy was not associated with INTER-NDA motor scores ({$\beta$} 0.02; 95\% CI -0.05, 0.09) and was associated with higher INTER-NDA total scores ({$\beta$} 0.08, 95\% CI 0.01, 0.16). Other comparisons did not show evidence for any associations. CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistencies and lack of specificity of the findings did not clarify the research question considering that we still have a large variability and uncertainty to define the risk or safety in the use of acetaminophen related to cognition in early childhood. More studies using better exposure assessment and better confounding variables are needed to clarify these associations.},

  abstract = {Background Pain during pregnancy is common, and its management is complex. Certain analgesics may increase the risk for adverse fetal and pregnancy outcomes, while poorly managed pain can result in adverse maternal outcomes such as depression and hypertension. Guidelines to assist clinicians in assessing risks and benefits of exposure to analgesics for the mother and unborn infant are lacking, necessitating evidence-based recommendations for managing pain in pregnancy. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted to assess pregnancy safety data for pharmacological and nonpharmacological pain management methods. Relevant clinical trials and observational studies were identified using multiple medical databases, and included studies were evaluated for quality and possible biases. Results Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are appropriate for mild to moderate pain, but NSAIDs should be avoided in the third trimester due to established risks. Short courses of weaker opioids are generally safe in pregnancy, although neonatal abstinence syndrome must be monitored following third trimester exposure. Limited safety data for pregabalin and gabapentin indicate that these are unlikely to be major teratogens, and tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have limited but overall reassuring safety data. Many of the included studies were limited by methodological issues. Conclusions Findings from this review can guide clinicians in their decision to prescribe analgesics for pregnant women. Treatment should be tailored to the lowest therapeutic dose and shortest possible duration, and management should involve a discussion of risks and benefits and monitoring for response. Further research is required to better understand the safety profile of various analgesics in pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Pre-eclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy that can affect both maternal and fetal outcomes. Early-onset pre-eclampsia (EOPET) is a severe form of pre-eclampsia that is associated with altered physiological characteristics and gene expression in the placenta. DNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic modification to DNA that can reflect gene expression, and can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such expression changes. This case \textendash control study focused on DNA methylation and gene expression of whole chorionic villi samples from 20 EOPET placentas and 20 gestational age-matched controls from pre-term births. DNA methylation was also assessed in placentas affected by late-onset pre-eclampsia (LOPET) and normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR). The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to assess DNA methylation at .480 000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites. The Illumina HT-12v4 Expression BeadChip was used to assess gene expression of .45 000 transcripts in a subset of cases and controls. DNA methylation analysis by pyrosequencing was used to follow-up the initial findings in four genes with a larger cohort of cases and controls, including nIUGR and LOPET placentas. Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify overrepresentation of gene ontology categories and transcription factor binding motifs. We identified 38 840 CpG sites with significant (false discovery rate ,0.01) DNA methylation alterations in EOPET, of which 282 had .12.5\% methylation difference compared with the controls. Significant sites were enriched at the enhancers and low CpG density regions of the associated genes and the majority (74.5\%) of these sites were hypomethylated in EOPET. EOPET, but not associated clinical features, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), presented a distinct DNA methylation profile. CpG sites from four genes relevant to pre-eclampsia (INHBA, BHLHE40, SLC2A1 and ADAM12) showed different extent of changes in LOPET and nIUGR. Genome-wide expression in a subset of samples showed that some of the gene expression changes were negatively correlated with DNA methylation changes, particularly for genes that are responsible for angiogenesis (such as EPAS1 and FLT1). Results could be confounded by altered cell populations in abnormal placentas. Larger sample sizes are needed to fully address the possibility of sub-profiles of methylation within the EOPET cohort. Based on DNA methylation profiling, we conclude that there are widespread DNA methylation alterations in EOPET that may be associated with changes in placental function. This property may provide a useful tool for early screening of such placentas. This study identifies DNA methylation changes at many loci previously reported to have altered gene expression in EOPET placentas, as well as in novel biologically relevant genes we confirmed to be differentially expressed. These results may be useful for DNA- methylation-based non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of at-risk pregnancies.},

For example, we recently showed that a subset of 5-HT1-receptors expressed in the fetal forebrain mediate a serotonergic modulation of thalamocortical axons response to axon guidance cues, both in vitro and in vivo. This influence of 5-HT signaling on fetal brain wiring raised important questions regarding the source of the ligand during pregnancy. Until recently, it was thought that 5-HT sources impacting brain development arose from maternal transport to the fetus, or from raphe neurons in the brainstem of the fetus. Using genetic mouse models, we uncovered previously unknown differences in 5-HT accumulation between the fore- and hindbrain during early and late fetal stages, through an exogenous source of 5-HT. Using additional genetic strategies, a new technology for studying placental biology ex vivo, and direct manipulation of placental neosynthesis, we investigated the nature of this exogenous source and uncovered a placental 5-HT synthetic pathway from a maternal tryptophan precursor, in both mice and humans. These results implicate a new, direct role for placental metabolic pathways in modulating fetal brain development and suggest an important role for maternal-placental-fetal interactions and 5-HT in the fetal programming of adult mental disorders.},

Method: A population-based pregnancy cohort study including 754 women who enrolled in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy (SELMA) study in pregnancy week 8\textendash 13. Two exposure measures were used: (1) maternally reported number of APAP tablets taken between conception and enrollment; (2) APAP urinary concentration at enrollment. Language development at 30 months was assessed by nurse's evaluation and parental questionnaire, including the number of words the child used ({$<$}25, 25\textendash 50 and {$>$}50). Main study outcome; parental report of use of fewer than 50 words, termed language delay (LD). Results: 59.2\% of women enrolled in weeks 8\textendash 13 reported taking APAP between conception and enrollment. APAP was measurable in all urine samples and urinary APAP was correlated with the number of APAP taken during pregnancy (P {$<$} 0.01). Language delay was more prevalent in boys (12.6\%) than girls (4.1\%) (8.5\% in total). Both the number of APAP tablets and urinary APAP concentration were associated with greater LD in girls but not in boys. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for LD among girls whose mothers reported {$>$}6 vs. 0 APAP tablets was 5.92 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.10\textendash 31.94). The OR for LD in girls whose mothers' urinary APAP was in the highest compared to the lowest quartile was 10.34 (95\% CI 1.37\textendash 77.86). While it cannot be ruled out, our available data do not support confounding by indication. Conclusions: Given the prevalence of prenatal APAP use and the importance of language development, these findings, if replicated, would suggest that pregnant women should limit their use of this analgesic during pregnancy.},

The utility of quantitative methylation assays at imprinted genes for the diagnosis of fetal and placental disorders. An imbalance of imprinted gene expression within 11p15.5 is observed in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), as well as in a variety of placental abnormalities including complete hydatidiform mole (CHM), placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD) and triploidy. To facilitate the diagnosis of epigenetic errors and chromosomal imbalance of 11p15.5, we validated a pyrosequencing assay to measure methylation at KvDMR1 using blood samples from 13 BWS cases, 8 of which showed reduced methylation as compared to control blood. An imbalance between maternal and paternal genomes as is found in triploidy, CHM or PMD was also associated with altered KvDMR1 methylation. A reciprocal pattern of methylation was obtained in the triploid cases by assaying the proximal 11p15.5 ICR associated with H19. To distinguish chromosome 11 specific alterations from whole genome imbalance, other imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) can be utilized. Thus, pyrosequencing assays for DMRs associated with SGCE, SNRPN, and MEST were also compared for their utility in diagnosing parental imbalance in placental samples. While each of these assays could successfully distinguish parental origin of triploidy, SGCE showed the clearest separation between groups. The combined use of a chromosome 11p15.5 assay (e.g. KvDMR1 or H19-ICR) and non-chromosome 11 assay (e.g. SGCE) provides a potentially valuable diagnostic tool in the rapid screening of methylation errors in placental disorders. These results also show the maintenance of imprinting status at these loci in the human placenta, even in the presence of abnormal pathology.},

The top DMP was located in SLC7A11A, a gene involved in cystine/glutamate transport and the biosynthesis of glutathione, an antioxidant that may protect against As-induced oxidative stress. Additional DMPs were located in genes associated with tumor development and glucose metabolism.

Method Between 1999 and 2008 all pregnant Norwegian women were eligible for recruitment into the prospective Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. The mothers were asked to report on their use of paracetamol at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and at 6 months postpartum. We used data on 48 631 children whose mothers returned the 3-year follow-up questionnaire by May 2011. Within this sample were 2919 same-sex sibling pairs who were used to adjust for familial and genetic factors. We modelled psychomotor development (communication, fine and gross motor development), externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems, and temperament (emotionality, activity, sociability and shyness) based on prenatal paracetamol exposure using generalized linear regression, adjusting for a number of factors, including febrile illness, infections and co-medication use during pregnancy. Results The sibling-control analysis revealed that children exposed to prenatal paracetamol for more than 28 days had poorer gross motor development [b 0.24, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.12\textendash 0.51], communication (b 0.20, 95\% CI 0.01\textendash 0.39), externalizing behaviour (b 0.28, 95\% CI 0.15\textendash 0.42), internalizing behaviour (b 0.14, 95\% CI 0.01\textendash 0.28), and higher activity levels (b 0.24, 95\% CI 0.11\textendash 0.38). Children exposed prenatally to short-term use of paracetamol (1\textendash 27 days) also had poorer gross motor outcomes (b 0.10, 95\% CI 0.02\textendash 0.19), but the effects were smaller than with long-term use. Ibuprofen exposure was not associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes. Conclusion Children exposed to long-term use of paracetamol during pregnancy had substantially adverse developmental outcomes at 3 years of age.},

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk of childhood diseases by disrupting hormonally mediated processes critical for growth and development during gestation, infancy, or childhood. The fetus, infant, and child may have enhanced sensitivity to environmental stressors like EDCs due to rapid development and greater exposure to some EDCs that results from their developmentally appropriate behavior, anatomy, and physiology. This review summarizes epidemiological studies examining the relations of early-life exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, triclosan, and perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) with childhood neurobehavioral disorders and obesity. The available epidemiological evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to several of these ubiquitous EDCs is associated with adverse neurobehavior (BPA and phthalates) and excess adiposity or increased risk of obesity/overweight (PFAS). Quantifying the effects of EDC mixtures, improving EDC exposure assessment, reducing bias from confounding, identifying periods of heightened vulnerability, and elucidating the presence and nature of sexually dimorphic EDC effects would result in stronger inferences from epidemiological studies. Ultimately, better estimates of the causal effects of EDC exposures on child health could help identify susceptible sub-populations and lead to public health interventions to reduce these exposures.},

Maternal urine was collected around 16 and 26 weeks of gestation and at birth. BPA concentrations were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography-isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Child behavior was assessed at 2 years of age using the second edition of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2).

METHODS: We used a prospective birth cohort of 244 mothers and their 3-year-old children from the greater Cincinnati, Ohio, area. We characterized gestational and childhood BPA exposures by using the mean BPA concentrations in maternal (16 and 26 weeks of gestation and birth) and child (1, 2, and 3 years of age) urine samples, respectively. Behavior and executive function were measured by using the Behavior Assessment System for Children 2 (BASC-2) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool (BRIEF-P). RESULTS: BPA was detected in {$>$}97\% of the gestational (median: 2.0 {$\mu$}g/L) and childhood (median: 4.1 {$\mu$}g/L) urine samples. With adjustment for confounders, each 10-fold increase in gestational BPA concentrations was associated with more anxious and depressed behavior on the BASC-2 and poorer emotional control and inhibition on the BRIEF-P. The magnitude of the gestational BPA associations differed according to child gender; BASC-2 and BRIEF-P scores increased 9 to 12 points among girls, but changes were null or negative among boys. Associations between childhood BPA exposure and neurobehavior were largely null and not modified by child gender. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, gestational BPA exposure affected behavioral and emotional regulation domains at 3 years of age, especially among girls.

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Phthalates are multifunctional chemicals used in personal care products, medications, and plastics. We reviewed the epidemiological literature examining the relationship between early life phthalate exposure and pediatric health outcomes. Recent Findings Five studies from Asia, Europe, and the US suggest that childhood exposure to di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP) may increase the risk of allergic diseases including asthma and eczema. Six studies from four different prospective cohorts report that gestational BBzP, DEHP, di-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di-ethyl phthalate (DEP) exposures are associated with alterations in infant/toddler physical development as well as parent-reported externalizing, internalizing, and autistic-like child behavior. However, there are inconsistencies related to the specific phthalates and behavioral domains. Two small studies report shorter anogenital distance among male infants with higher gestational phthalate exposure. Summary Several epidemiological studies suggest fetal and childhood exposure to some phthalates may perturb normal development, with several studies consistently reporting increased risk of allergic diseases with DEHP and BBzP exposure. While anticipatory guidance is not evidence-based at this time, providers can counsel concerned patients to reduce phthalate exposures in order to protect the developing fetus and child from potential adverse health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may be involved in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders, but identifying relevant chemicals within mixtures of EDCs is difficult. Objective: Our goal was to identify gestational EDC exposures associated with autistic behaviors. Methods: We measured the concentrations of 8 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, 25 poly\- chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 6 organochlorine pesticides, 8 brominated flame retardants, and 4 perfluoroalkyl substances in blood or urine samples from 175 pregnant women in the HOME (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment) Study (Cincinnati, OH). When children were 4 and 5 years old, mothers completed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a measure of autistic behaviors. We examined confounder-adjusted associations between 52 EDCs and SRS scores using a twostage hierarchical analysis to account for repeated measures and confounding by correlated EDCs. Results: Most of the EDCs were associated with negligible absolute differences in SRS scores ({$\leq$} 1.5). Each 2-SD increase in serum concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ether-28 (PBDE-28) ({$\beta$} = 2.5; 95\% CI: \textendash 0.6, 5.6) or trans-nonachlor ({$\beta$} = 4.1; 95\% CI: 0.8\textendash 7.3) was associated with more autistic behaviors. In contrast, fewer autistic behaviors were observed among children born to women with detectable versus nondetectable concentrations of PCB-178 ({$\beta$} = \textendash 3.0; 95\% CI: \textendash 6.3, 0.2), {$\beta$}-hexachlorocyclohexane ({$\beta$} = \textendash 3.3; 95\% CI: \textendash 6.1, \textendash 0.5), or PBDE-85 ({$\beta$} = \textendash 3.2; 95\% CI: \textendash 5.9, \textendash 0.5). Increasing perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) concentrations were also associated with fewer autistic behaviors ({$\beta$} = \textendash 2.0; 95\% CI: \textendash 4.4, 0.4). Conclusions: Some EDCs were associated with autistic behaviors in this cohort, but our modest sample size precludes us from dismissing chemicals with null associations. PFOA, {$\beta$}-hexachlorocyclohexane, PCB-178, PBDE-28, PBDE-85, and trans-nonachlor deserve additional scrutiny as factors that may be associated with childhood autistic behaviors.},

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been associated with adverse neurodevelopment in epidemiological studies. However, prior studies had limited statistical power to examine sex-specific effects, and few examined child cognition. Objectives: We estimated the association between prenatal BPA exposure and child neurobehavior at 3 y of age in a prospective cohort of 812 mothers and their children. Methods: We measured BPA concentration in urine samples collected at {$\sim$}12 wk gestation among women enrolled in a 10-city Canadian cohort study. At approximately 3 y of age, we assessed children's cognitive abilities with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence\texttrademark\textendash III (WPPSI-III) and two scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function\textendash Preschool (BRIEF-P). Parents reported children's behavior using the Behavior Assessment System for Children\textendash 2 (BASC-2) and the Social Responsiveness Scale\texttrademark{} \textendash{} 2. (SRS-2). We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in neurobehavioral outcomes with a doubling in BPA concentration and sex-specific associations. Results: BPA was not associated with WPPSI-III scores; child sex did not modify these associations. The association between BPA and BRIEF-P scores was modified by child sex (BPA\texttimes sex\hspace{0.6em}p-values{$\leq$}0.03). For example, a doubling of BPA concentration was associated with 1-point (95\% CI: 0.3, 1.7) poorer working memory in boys and 0.5-point (95\% CI: -1.1, 0.1) better scores in girls. BPA was not associated with most BASC-2 scales; however, it was associated with more internalizing and somatizing behaviors in boys, but not in girls (BPA\texttimes sex p-values{$\leq$}0.08). A doubling of BPA concentration was associated with poorer SRS-2 scores [{$\beta$}=0.3 ( 95\% CI: 0, 0.7)]; this association was not modified by sex. Conclusion: Prenatal urinary BPA concentration was associated with some aspects of child behavior in this cohort, and some associations were stronger among boys. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP984},

  abstract = {Background Prenatal chemical exposures may adversely affect neurodevelopment, but few studies have examined the persistence of these associations. We examined whether associations between prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) or polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) exposures persist or resolve as children age. Methods We followed 346 mother-child pairs (enrolled 2003\textendash 2006) from Cincinnati, OH from pregnancy until children were 8 years old. We measured BPA in urine collected at 16 and 26 weeks gestation and PBDE-47 in serum collected at 16 weeks gestation. We administered repeated measures of children's behavior, mental/psychomotor development, and IQ from ages 1\textendash 8 years. We determined if associations of BPA or PBDE-47 with child neurobehavior persisted or resolved as children aged using linear mixed models and estimated neurobehavioral measure reproducibility using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results Higher BPA in girls and higher PBDE-47 in both boys and girls were associated with more externalizing behaviors; these associations persisted from ages 2\textendash 8 years (exposure \texttimes{} age interaction p-values{$\geq$}0.36). Higher PBDE-47 concentrations were associated with decreases in MDI from ages 1\textendash 3 years (PBDE-47 \texttimes{} age interaction p-value=0.03) and persistently lower IQ at ages 5 and 8 years (PBDE-47 \texttimes{} age interaction p-value=0.56). Mental/psychomotor abilities had fair reproducibility from ages 1\textendash 3 years (ICCs\textasciitilde 0.4), cognitive abilities from ages 5 to 8 years had excellent reproducibility (ICCs=0.7\textendash 0.8), and parent-reported behaviors from ages 2\textendash 8 years had poor to good reproducibility (ICCs=0.38\textendash 0.59). Conclusions Prenatal BPA and PBDE-47 concentrations were persistently associated with more externalizing behaviors. PBDE-47 concentrations were inversely associated with cognitive abilities that strengthened over time.},

  abstract = {Context: GNAS is one of few genetic loci that undergo allelic-specific methylation resulting in the parent-specific expression of at least four different transcripts. Due to monoallelic expression, heterozygous GNAS mutations affecting either paternally or maternally derived transcripts cause different forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), including autosomal-dominant PHP type Ib (AD-PHP1B) associated with loss of methylation (LOM) at exon A/B alone or sporadic PHP1B (sporPHP1B) associated with broad GNAS methylation changes. Similar to effects other imprinted genes have on early development, we recently observed severe intrauterine growth retardation in newborns, later diagnosed with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) because of paternal GNAS loss-of-function mutations. Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether GNAS methylation abnormalities affect intrauterine growth. Patients and Methods: Birth parameters were collected of patients who later developed sporPHP1B or AD-PHP1B, and of their healthy siblings. Comparisons were made to newborns affected by PPHP or PHP1A. Results: As newborns, AD-PHP1B patients were bigger than their healthy siblings and well above the reference average; increased sizes were particularly evident if the mothers were unaffected carriers of STX16 deletions. SporPHP1B newborns were slightly above average for weight and length, but their overgrowth was less pronounced than that of AD-PHP1B newborns from unaffected mothers. Conclusion: LOM at GNAS exon A/B due to maternal STX16 deletions and the resulting biallelic A/B expression are associated with enhanced fetal growth. These findings are distinctly different from those of PPHP patients with paternal GNAS exons 2\textendash 13 mutations, whose birth parameters are almost 4.5 z-scores below those of AD-PHP1B patients born to healthy mothers.},

  abstract = {Background Paracetamol is the first choice for antipyretic or analgesic treatment throughout pregnancy. Products with Paracetamol are readily available over the counter and therefore easily accessible for self-medication. Epidemiological data on Paracetamol intake pattern during pregnancy and its potential immunological effects are sparse. We aimed to analyze a possible association between Paracetamol medication and numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in cord blood. Methods The objective was addressed in the PRINCE (PRENATAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH) study, a population-based prospective pregnancy cohort study initiated in 2011 at the University Medical Center in Hamburg, Germany. 518 healthy pregnant women with singleton pregnancies were recruited during the first trimester. Three examinations were scheduled at the end of the 1st (gestational week 12\textendash 14), the 2nd (gestational week 22\textendash 24) and the 3rd trimester (gestational week 34\textendash 36). For 146 of these women, cord blood flow cytometry data were available. Paracetamol intake was assessed for each trimester of pregnancy. Findings Among the 518 enrolled women, 40\% took Paracetamol as main analgesic treatment during pregnancy. The intake frequency and dosage of Paracetamol varied between the women and was overall low with a tendency towards higher frequencies and higher dosages in the third trimester. Paracetamol intake, particularly during the third trimester, resulted in decreased relative numbers of HSCs in cord blood, independent of maternal age, first-trimester BMI, parity, gestational age and birth weight (-0.286 (95\% CI -0.592, 0.021), p=0.068). Interpretation Prenatal Paracetamol intake, especially during the third trimester, may be causally involved in decreasing HSCs in cord blood.},

  abstract = {Tenascin-X is an extracellular matrix protein initially identified because the gene encoding it overlaps with the human CYP21B gene. Because studies of gene and protein function of other tenascins had been poorly predictive of essential functions in vivo, we used a genetic approach that critically relied on an understanding of the genomic locus to uncover an association between inactivating tenascin-X mutations and novel recessive and dominant forms of Ehlers\textendash Danlos syndrome (EDS). Tenascin-X provides the first example of a gene outside of the fibrillar collagens and their processing enzymes that causes EDS. Tenascin-X null mice recapitulate the skin findings of the human disease, confirming a causative role for this gene in EDS. Further evaluation of these mice showed that tenascin-X is an important regulator of collagen deposition in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism of disease in this form of EDS. Further studies suggest that tenascin-X may do this through both direct and indirect interactions with the collagen fibril. Recent studies show that TNX effects on matrix extend beyond the collagen to the elastogenic pathway and matrix remodeling enzymes. Tenascin-X serves as a compelling example of how human ``experiments of nature'' can guide us to an understanding of genes whose function may not be evident from their sequence or in vitro studies of their encoded proteins. \textcopyright{} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Few studies have implemented an epigenome-wide approach. Using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K), we investigated epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation in relation to maternal experiences of traumatic and non-traumatic stressors over her lifetime assessed using the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R) survey (n = 207). We found differential DNA methylation at epigenome-wide statistical significance (FDR = 0.05) for 112 CpGs. Additionally, we observed three clusters that exhibited differential methylation in response to high maternal lifetime stress. Enrichment analyses, conducted at an FDR = 0.20, revealed lysine degradation to be the most significant pathway associated with maternal lifetimes stress exposure. Targeted enrichment analyses of the three largest clusters of probes, identified using the gap statistic, were enriched for genes associated with endocytosis (i.e., SMAP1, ANKFY1), tight junctions (i.e., EPB41L4B), and metabolic pathways (i.e., INPP5E, EEF1B2). These pathways, also identified in the top 10 KEGG pathways associated with maternal lifetime stress exposure, play important roles in multiple physiological functions necessary for proper fetal development. Further, two genes were identified to exhibit multiple probes associated with maternal lifetime stress (i.e., ANKFY1, TM6SF1). The methylation status of the probes belonging to each cluster and/or genes exhibiting multiple hits, may play a role in the pathogenesis of adverse health outcomes in children born to mothers with increased lifetime stress exposure.},

  abstract = {During human pregnancy, the production of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) rises steadily to eighty fold at term, and placenta has been found to specifically bind estrogens. We have recently demonstrated the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) protein in human placenta and its localization in villous cytotrophoblast (CT), vascular pericytes, and amniotic fibroblasts. In vitro, E2 stimulated development of large syncytiotrophoblast (ST) aggregates. In the present study we utilized ER-beta affinity purified polyclonal (N19:sc6820) and ER-alpha monoclonal (clone h-151) antibodies. Western blot analysis revealed a single \textasciitilde 52 kDa ER-beta band in chorionic villi (CV) protein extracts. In CV, strong cytoplasmic ER-beta immunoreactivity was confined to ST. Dual color immunohistochemistry revealed asymmetric segregation of ER-alpha in dividing villous CT cells. Prior to separation, the cell nuclei more distant from ST exhibited high ER-alpha, while cell nuclei associated with ST showed diminution of ER-alpha and appearance of ER-beta. In trophoblast cultures, development of ST aggregates was associated with diminution of ER-alpha and appearance of ER-beta immunoreactivity. ER-beta was also detected in endothelial cells, amniotic epithelial cells and fibroblasts, extravillous trophoblast (nuclear and cytoplasmic) and decidual cells (cytoplasmic only). In addition, CFK-E12 (E12) and CWK-F12 (F12) monoclonal antibodies, which recognize \textasciitilde 64 kDa ER-beta with hormone binding domain, showed nuclear-specific reactivity with villous ST, extravillous trophoblast, and amniotic epithelium and fibroblasts. Western blot analysis indicated abundant expression of a \textasciitilde 64 kDa ER-beta variant in trophoblast cultures, significantly higher when compared to the chorionic villi and freshly isolated trophoblast cell protein extracts. This is the first report on ER-beta expression in human placenta and cultured trophoblast. Our data indicate that during trophoblast differentiation, the ER-alpha is associated with a less, and ER-beta with the more differentiated state. Enhanced expression of \textasciitilde 64 kDa ER-beta variant in trophoblast cultures suggests a unique role of ER-beta hormone binding domain in the regulation of trophoblast differentiation. Our data also indicate that asymmetric segregation of ER-alpha may play a role in asymmetric division of estrogen-dependent cells.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor driven by cells with hallmarks of neural stem (NS) cells. GBM stem cells frequently express high levels of the transcription factors FOXG1 and SOX2. Here we show that increased expression of these factors restricts astrocyte differentiation and can trigger dedifferentiation to a proliferative NS cell state. Transcriptional targets include cell cycle and epigenetic regulators (e.g., Foxo3, Plk1, Mycn, Dnmt1, Dnmt3b, and Tet3). Foxo3 is a critical repressed downstream effector that is controlled via a conserved FOXG1/SOX2-bound cis-regulatory element. Foxo3 loss, combined with exposure to the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine, enforces astrocyte dedifferentiation. DNA methylation profiling in differentiating astrocytes identifies changes at multiple polycomb targets, including the promoter of Foxo3 In patient-derived GBM stem cells, CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of FOXG1 does not impact proliferation in vitro; however, upon transplantation in vivo, FOXG1-null cells display increased astrocyte differentiation and up-regulate FOXO3. In contrast, SOX2 ablation attenuates proliferation, and mutant cells cannot be expanded in vitro. Thus, FOXG1 and SOX2 operate in complementary but distinct roles to fuel unconstrained self-renewal in GBM stem cells via transcriptional control of core cell cycle and epigenetic regulators.},

  abstract = {Organophosphorus (OP) insecticides are pest-control agents heavily used worldwide. Unfortunately, they are also well known for the toxic effects that they can trigger in humans. Clinical manifestations of an acute exposure of humans to OP insecticides include a well-defined cholinergic crisis that develops as a result of the irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Prolonged exposures to levels of OP insecticides that are insufficient to trigger signs of acute intoxication, which are hereafter referred to as subacute exposures, have also been associated with neurological deficits. In particular, epidemiological studies have reported statistically significant correlations between prenatal subacute exposures to OP insecticides, including chlorpyrifos, and neurological deficits that range from cognitive impairments to tremors in childhood. The primary objectives of this article are: (i) to address the short- and long-term neurological issues that have been associated with acute and subacute exposures of humans to OP insecticides, especially early in life (ii) to discuss the translational relevance of animal models of developmental exposure to OP insecticides, and (iii) to review mechanisms that are likely to contribute to the developmental neurotoxicity of OP insecticides. Most of the discussion will be focused on chlorpyrifos, the top-selling OP insecticide in the United States and throughout the world. These points are critical for the identification and development of safe and effective interventions to counter and/or prevent the neurotoxic effects of these chemicals in the developing brain.},

  abstract = {Background Heart failure (HF) is associated with inflammation characterized by the formation of the inflammasome, which triggers maturation of inflammatory cytokines. Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), a vital component of the inflammasome, is controlled through epigenetic modification, which may be a candidate pathway for worsening HF. This study examined the inflammasome pathway in HF and the relationships between ASC CpG methylation and outcomes in HF. Methods and Results Stored samples from 155 HF outpatients (ejection fraction 29.9\,{$\pm$}\,14.9\%) were analyzed for percentage methylation of 7 CpG sites in the intron region preceding exon 1 of the ASC gene. ASC methylation was inversely related to ASC mRNA (r\,=\,-0.33; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and protein (r\,=\,-0.464; P\,{$<$}\,.001). ASC methylation had a positive linear relationship with ejection fraction (r\,=\,0.85; P\,{$<$}\,.001), quality of life (r\,=\,0.83; P\,{$<$}\,.001), and 6-minute walk test (r\,=\,0.59; P\,=\,.023) and a negative linear relationship with depression (r\,=\,-0.81; P\,{$<$}\,.001) and anxiety (r\,=\,-0.75; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Higher ASC methylation was associated with a lower risk for clinical events (hazard ratio [HR] 0.16; P\,=\,.025), whereas higher protein (HR\,=\,1.78; P\,=\,.045) and mRNA expression (HR\,=\,1.18; P\,=\,.05) were associated with a greater risk. Conclusions Increased methylation of CpG sites in the intron region of ASC is associated with improved outcomes in HF. The associated decrease in ASC expression implicates this inflammatory mediator as a possible driver of HF outcomes and may represent a therapeutic target.},

Epigenetic alterations are present in different tissues along the aging process and in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epigenetics affect life span and longevity. AD-related genes exhibit epigenetic changes, indicating that epigenetics might exert a pathogenic role in dementia. Epigenetic modifications are reversible and can potentially be targeted by pharmacological intervention. Epigenetic drugs may be useful for the treatment of major problems of health (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, brain disorders). The efficacy and safety of these and other medications depend upon the efficiency of the pharmacogenetic process in which different clusters of genes (pathogenic, mechanistic, metabolic, transporter, pleiotropic) are involved. Most of these genes are also under the influence of the epigenetic machinery. The information available on the pharmacoepigenomics of most drugs is very limited; however, growing evidence indicates that epigenetic changes are determinant in the pathogenesis of many medical conditions and in drug response and drug resistance. Consequently, pharmacoepigenetic studies should be incorporated in drug development and personalized treatments.},

Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation may modulate POMC expression and provide a biological link between early life exposures and later phenotype. Animal studies suggest epigenetic marks at POMC are influenced by maternal energy excess and restriction, prenatal stress and Triclosan exposure. Postnatal factors including energy excess, folate, vitamin A, conjugated linoleic acid and leptin may also affect POMC methylation. Recent human studies suggest POMC DNA methylation is influenced by maternal nutrition in early pregnancy and associated with childhood and adult obesity. Studies in children propose a link between POMC DNA methylation and elevated lipids and insulin, independent of body habitus. This review brings together evidence from animal and human studies and suggests that POMC is sensitive to nutritional programming and is associated with a wide range of weight-related and metabolic outcomes.},

Here, we showed that when pregnant mice were treated with 8\,mg/kg TCS (8-TCS mice) on gestational days (GD) 6\textendash 18 fetal body weights were lower than controls. Placental weights and volumes were reduced in 8-TCS mice. The placental proliferative cells and expression of PCNA and Cyclin D3 on GD13 were remarkably decreased in 8-TCS mice. The decreases in activities and expression of placental System A amino acid or glucose transporters on GD14 and GD17 were observed in 8-TCS mice. Levels of serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) were lower in 8-TCS mice than those in controls. Declines of placental Akt, mTOR and P70S6K phosphorylation in 8-TCS mice were corrected by L-thyroxinein (T4). Treating 8-TCS mice with T4 rescued the placental cell proliferation and recovered the activity and expression of amino acid and glucose transporters, which were sensitive to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin. Furthermore, the replacement of T4 could rescue the decrease in fetal body weight, which was blocked by rapamycin. These findings indicate that TCS-induced hypothyroxinemia in gestation mice through reducing Akt-mTOR signaling may impair placental development and nutrient transfer leading to decreases in fetal body weight.},

Methods: A discovery phase was conducted in Project Viva, a prospective pre-birth cohort study with external replication in an independent cohort, the Generation R Study. In Project Viva, pregnant women were recruited between 1999 and 2002 in Eastern Massachusetts, USA. In the Generation R Study, pregnant women were recruited between 2002 and 2006 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. In Project Viva, 479 infants had data on maternal antidepressant use, anxiety, depression, and cord blood DNA methylation, 120 children had DNA methylation measured in early childhood (\textasciitilde{} 3 years), and 460 in mid-childhood (\textasciitilde{} 7 years). In the Generation R Study, 999 infants had data on maternal antidepressants and cord blood DNA methylation. The prenatal antidepressant prescription was obtained from medical records. At-mid pregnancy, symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed with the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in Project Viva and with the Brief Symptom Inventory in the Generation R Study.

Mean birth weight was 3,443 (standard deviation, 423) g, and 38 mothers (8.6\%) reported smoking at a mean of 9.4 weeks of gestation. Prenatal maternal smoking was associated with a 175-g lower birth weight (95\% confidence interval (CI): -305.5, -44.8) and with differential DNAm of 71 CpGs in placenta, robust to latent-factor adjustment reflecting cell types (Bonferroni-adjusted P {$<$} 6.94 \texttimes{} 10-8).

  abstract = {The increasing incidence of autism suggests a major environmental influence. Epidemiology has implicated many candidates and genetics many susceptibility genes. Gene/environment interactions in autism were analysed using 206 autism susceptibility genes (ASG's) from the Autworks database to interrogate \textasciitilde 1 million chemical/gene interactions in the comparative toxicogenomics database. Any bias towards ASG's was statistically determined for each chemical. Many suspect compounds identified in epidemiology, including tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, pesticides, particulate matter, benzo(a)pyrene, heavy metals, valproate, acetaminophen, SSRI's, cocaine, bisphenol A, phthalates, polyhalogenated biphenyls, flame retardants, diesel constituents, terbutaline and oxytocin, inter alia showed a significant degree of bias towards ASG's, as did relevant endogenous agents (retinoids, sex steroids, thyroxine, melatonin, folate, dopamine, serotonin). Numerous other suspected endocrine disruptors (over 100) selectively targeted ASG's including paraquat, atrazine and other pesticides not yet studied in autism and many compounds used in food, cosmetics or household products, including tretinoin, soy phytoestrogens, aspartame, titanium dioxide and sodium fluoride. Autism polymorphisms influence the sensitivity to some of these chemicals and these same genes play an important role in barrier function and control of respiratory cilia sweeping particulate matter from the airways. Pesticides, heavy metals and pollutants also disrupt barrier and/or ciliary function, which is regulated by sex steroids and by bitter/sweet taste receptors. Further epidemiological studies and neurodevelopmental and behavioural research is warranted to determine the relevance of large number of suspect candidates whose addition to the environment, household, food and cosmetics might be fuelling the autism epidemic in a gene-dependent manner.},

  abstract = {Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) may be a neurodevelopmental toxicant, but evidence is not consistent in terms of the sex-specific patterns of the associations and the specific behavioral or cognitive domains most affected. Objective: To examine the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on cognitive, psychomotor, and behavioral development in 438 children at 1, 4 and 7 years of age. Methods: BPA was measured in spot urine samples collected in trimester 1 and 3 of pregnancy from women participating in the INMA-Sabadell birth cohort study. Cognitive and psychomotor development was assessed at 1 and 4 years using psychologist-based scales. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and other behavioral problems were assessed at 4 years by teachers and at 7 years by parents using questionnaire-based rating scales. Results: Geometric mean creatinine-adjusted BPA concentration of the averaged samples was 2.6 {$\mu$}g/g creatinine. BPA exposure was not associated with the cognitive scores or their subscales at 1 and 4 years of age. At 1 year of age, exposure in the highest tertile of BPA concentrations was associated with a reduction of psychomotor scores (T3 vs T1 {$\beta\frac{1}{4}$} \`A 4.28 points, 95\% CI: \`A 8.15, \`A 0.41), but there was no association with psychomotor outcomes at 4 years. At 4 years, BPA exposure was associated with an increased risk of ADHDhyperactivity symptoms (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) per log10 {$\mu$}g BPA/g creatinine increase{$\frac{1}{4}$}1.72; 1.08, 2.73) and this association was stronger in boys than in girls. Further, boys had an increased risk of ADHD-inattention symptoms whereas girls showed a reduced risk (p for interaction o0.1). At 7 years, these associations were not statistically significant nor were any other behavioral problems. Conclusions: These results suggest that prenatal BPA exposure does not affect cognitive development up to age 4 years. Associations are observed with psychomotor development and ADHD-related symptoms at early ages, but these do not appear to persist until later ages.},

  abstract = {Background Exposome studies are challenged by exposure misclassification for non-persistent chemicals, whose temporal variability contributes to bias in dose-response functions. Objectives We evaluated the variability of urinary concentrations of 24 non-persistent chemicals: 10 phthalate metabolites, 7 phenols, 6 organophosphate (OP) pesticide metabolites, and cotinine, between weeks from different pregnancy trimesters in pregnant women, and between days and between seasons in children. Methods 154 pregnant women and 152 children from six European countries were enrolled in 2014\textendash 2015. Pregnant women provided three urine samples over a day (morning, midday, and night), for one week in the 2nd and 3rd pregnancy trimesters. Children provided two urines a day (morning and night), over two one-week periods, six months apart. We pooled all samples for a given subject that were collected within a week. In children, we also made four daily pools (combining morning and night voids) during the last four days of the first follow-up week. Pools were analyzed for all 24 metabolites of interest. We calculated intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and estimated the number of pools needed to obtain an ICC above 0.80. Results All phthalate metabolites and phenols were detected in {$>$}90\% of pools whereas certain OP pesticide metabolites and cotinine were detected in {$<$}43\% of pools. We observed fair (ICC = 0.40\textendash 0.59) to good (0.60\textendash 0.74) between-day reliability of the pools of two samples in children for all chemicals. Reliability was poor ({$<$}0.40) to fair between trimesters in pregnant women and between seasons in children. For most chemicals, three daily pools of two urines each (for weekly exposure windows) and four weekly pools of 15\textendash 20 urines each would be necessary to obtain an ICC above 0.80. Conclusions This quantification of the variability of biomarker measurements of many non-persistent chemicals during several time windows shows that for many of these compounds a few dozen samples are required to accurately assess exposure over periods encompassing several trimesters or months.},

We measured the concentration of the EDs in maternal and cord blood samples of 29 mother-newborn pairs from the Pertini Hospital in Rome between March and June 2016. Each mother reported demographic, life style and diet information. We compared concentrations of the endocrine disruptors between mother and newborn, and among different molecules. We analyzed differences and trends of each ED substance according to the demography and diet information. PFOA levels in maternal blood showed a negative association with newborn weight. Concentration levels of PFOA in both maternal and cord blood of those with physiological progression of pregnancy were higher in than in those with pathological pregnancies. MEHP trend showed a positive association with maternal age. These results confirm the maternal-to-fetus transfer of EDs through the placenta and the impact that endocrine disruptors have on pregnancy and birth outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) during prenatal and postnatal life has been extensively studied in relation to adverse health effects in children. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to identify determinants of the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers, PBDEs; polybrominated biphenyl, PBB), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in blood samples from pregnant women and children in The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). METHODS: Blood samples were collected from two independent subsamples within MoBa; a group of women (n=96) enrolled in mid-pregnancy during the years 2002-2008 and a group of 3 year old children (n=99) participating during 2010-2011. PCB congeners (74, 99, 138, 153, 180, 170, 194, 209, 105, 114, 118, 156, 157, 167, and 189), brominated flame retardants (PBDE-28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and PBB-153), as well as the OCPs hexachlorobenzene (HCB), oxychlordane, 4,4'dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and 4,4'dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) were measured in both pregnant women and children. RESULTS: Age, low parity, and low pre-pregnant BMI were the most important determinants of increased plasma concentrations of POPs in pregnant women. In 3 year old children, prolonged breastfeeding duration was a major determinant of increased POP concentrations. Estimated dietary exposure to PCBs during pregnancy was positively associated with plasma concentrations in 3 year old children, but not in pregnant women. Plasma concentrations were approximately 40\% higher in children compared to pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors associated with exposure and toxicokinetics, i.e. accumulation, excretion and transfer via breastmilk of POPs were the main predictors of POP levels in pregnant women and children. Diet, which is the main exposure source for these compounds in the general population, was found to predict PCB levels only among children. For the PBDEs, for which non-dietary sources are more important, toxicokinetic factors appeared to have less predictive impact.},

Two hundred twenty seven studies were searched from databases. Among those, 41 systematic reviews (SRs) were included: 9 focused on prenatal factors, 5 on perinatal factors, and 27 on postnatal factors. Of these 41 SRs, 83\% had good methodological quality, as determined by the AMSTAR tool. After reviewing all evidence, parental asthma, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke and prematurity (particularly very preterm birth) are well-established risk factors for childhood asthma. Current findings do suggest mild to moderate causal effects of certain modifiable behaviors or exposures during pregnancy (maternal weight gain or obesity, maternal use of antibiotics or paracetamol, and maternal stress), the perinatal period (birth by Caesarean delivery), or postnatal life (severe RSV infection, overweight or obesity, indoor exposure to mold or fungi, and outdoor air pollution) on childhood asthma, but this suggestive evidence must be confirmed in interventional studies or (if interventions are not feasible) well-designed prospective studies.},

  abstract = {Organophosphate based pesticides are widely used in the agricultural sector, and exposure to these chemicals is common for the general population. Pesticides are toxic due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterases, and the potential for adverse health effects have been investigated in past and recent studies. Human biomonitoring of organophosphate pesticide exposure is carried out through the determination of the metabolites in urine (dialkylphosphates, DAPs). Hereby we present a new method for determination of the 6 non-specific metabolites dimethyl phosphate (DMP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), dimethyl dithiophosphate (DMDTP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP) in urine based on off-line solid phase extraction (anion exchange, 96-well plates) followed by ion-pair ultra-performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Recoveries and accuracies in control urine spiked at 5ng/mL ranged from 48\% to109\% and from 91\% to 115\%, respectively. The method limits of detection for the DAPs were 1.2ng/mL for DMP, 0.38ng/mL for DEP, 0.20ng/mL for DMTP, 0.33ng/mL for DETP, 0.64ng/mL for DMDTP, and 0.15ng/mL for DEDTP. The method was applied to samples from a Norwegian mother/child study group (n=48/56) and the DAPs detection frequencies in urine from mothers and children were about: 40\% for DMP, 95\% for DEP, 96\% for DMTP, 50\% for DETP, 15\% for DMDTP, and 1\% for DEDTP. In both mothers and children, the most abundant DAPs were DMTP (median 2.4/5.2ng/mL) and DEP (median 2.6/3.4ng/mL) followed by DMP (median 1.5/2.1ng/mL). The SG corrected concentrations of DEP and DETP in mothers were statistically higher than in children (p-value{$<$}0.05; Mann-Whitney test) which might suggest a higher exposure to pesticides in these mothers, or significant differences in toxicokinetics between adults and children. The method was proven robust and suitable for large-scale biomonitoring studies.},

We performed RNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis to reveal two distinct subgroups with one consisting entirely of A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Two genes differentiating A-D-M mutant from A-D-M WT PanNETs were high ARX and low PDX1 gene expression with PDX1 promoter hyper-methylation in the A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Moreover, A-D-M mutant PanNETs had a gene expression signature related to that of alpha-cells (FDR q-value\,{$<$}\,0.009) of pancreatic islets including increased expression of HNF1A and its transcriptional target genes. This gene expression profile suggests that A-D-M mutant PanNETs originate from or transdifferentiate into a distinct cell type similar to alpha cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: While paracetamol exposure in pregnancy and early infancy has been associated with asthma, it remains unclear whether this is confounded by respiratory tract infections, which have been suggested as an alternative explanation. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies that reported the association between paracetamol exposure during pregnancy or infancy and the subsequent development of childhood asthma ({$\geq$}5\hspace{0.25em}years). METHODS: Two independent researchers searched the databases EMBASE and PUBMED on 12 August 2013 for relevant articles using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed and results were pooled using fixed effect models or random effect models when moderate between-study heterogeneity was observed. We explicitly assessed whether the observed associations are due to confounding by respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: Eleven observational cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. Any paracetamol use during the first trimester was related to increased risk of childhood asthma (5 studies, pooled OR=1.39, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.91) but there was marked between-study heterogeneity (I(2)=63\%) and only one of these studies adjusted for maternal respiratory tract infections. Increasing frequency of use of paracetamol during infancy was associated with increased odds of childhood asthma (3 studies, pooled OR=1.15, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.31 per doubling of days exposure), but in these same three studies adjusting for respiratory tract infections reduced this association (OR=1.06, 95\% CI 0.92 to 1.22). DISCUSSION: The association during early pregnancy exposure was highly variable between studies and exposure during infancy appears to be moderately confounded by respiratory tract infections. There is insufficient evidence to warrant changing guidelines on early life paracetamol exposure at this time.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) is a commonly used technique for handling missing data in large-scale medical and public health studies. An important and longstanding statistical problem is how to conduct variable selection on the multiply-imputed data. If a variable selection method is applied to each imputed dataset separately, it may select different variables in different imputed datasets and make it difficult to interpret the final model or draw the scientific conclusions. In this paper, we propose two novel variable selection methods for the multiply-imputed data. Both methods jointly fit models on multiple imputed datasets and yield a consistent selection of variables across all imputed datasets. The first method is called MI-stepwise method, which is an extension of the stepwise selection method. It is implemented by first obtaining combined p-values using Rubin's rules for MI inference (Rubin 1987; Little and Rubin 2002) and then selecting variables base on the combined p-values in each step of selection. The second method is called MI-lasso method, which is an extension of the lasso method (Tibshrani, 1996). It treats the estimated regression coefficients of the same variable across all imputed datasets as a group, and applies the group lasso penalty (Yuan and Lin 2006) to yield a consistent variable selection across multiple imputed datasets. The proposed methods are demonstrated using simulation studies. We also apply the two methods to the University of Michigan Dioxin Exposure Study (UMDES) to identify important environmental exposure factors that are associated with serum dioxin concentrations.},

Infection and inflammation are critical processes in placental development and pregnancy-related diseases. In particular, infection is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, to date, no successful approach has been developed for the effective diagnosis of infection in preterm infants. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a serious disorder that adversely affects \textasciitilde 5\% of human pregnancies. Recent studies identified a multiprotein complex, the inflammasome, including the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase-1, which plays a vital role in the placenta. The thyroid hormone modulates inflammation processes and is additionally implicated in placental development and disease. Therefore, elucidation of thyroid hormone receptor-regulated inflammation-related molecules, and their underlying mechanisms in placenta, should facilitate the identification of novel predictive and therapeutic targets for placental disorders. This review provides a detailed summary of current knowledge with respect to identification of useful biomarkers and their physiological significance in placenta.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence shows that mutations in several driver genes can cause aberrant methylation patterns, a hallmark of cancer. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that the landscapes of tumor genomes and epigenomes are tightly interconnected. We measured this relationship using principal component analyses and methylation-mutation associations applied at the nucleotide level and with respect to genome-wide trends. We found that a few mutated driver genes were associated with genome-wide patterns of aberrant hypomethylation or CpG island hypermethylation in specific cancer types. In addition, we identified associations between 737 mutated driver genes and site-specific methylation changes. Moreover, using these mutation-methylation associations, we were able to distinguish between two uterine and two thyroid cancer subtypes. The driver gene mutation\textendash associated methylation differences between the thyroid cancer subtypes were linked to differential gene expression in JAK-STAT signaling, NADPH oxidation, and other cancer-related pathways. These results establish that driver gene mutations are associated with methylation alterations capable of shaping regulatory network functions. In addition, the methodology presented here can be used to subdivide tumors into more homogeneous subsets corresponding to underlying molecular characteristics, which could improve treatment efficacy., Mutations that alter the function of driver genes by changing DNA nucleotides have been recognized as key players in cancer progression. However, recent evidence has shown that DNA methylation, which can control gene expression, is also highly dysregulated in cancer and contributes to carcinogenesis. Whether methylation alterations correspond to mutated driver genes in cancer remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed 4,302 tumors from 18 cancer types and demonstrated that driver gene mutations are inherently connected with the aberrant DNA methylation landscape in cancer. We showed that driver gene\textendash associated methylation patterns can classify heterogeneous tumors within a cancer type into homogeneous subtypes and have the potential to influence genes that contribute to tumor growth. This finding could help us better understand the fundamental connection between driver gene mutations and DNA methylation alterations in cancer, and to further improve cancer treatment.},

Epidemiologic data in growth-altered fetuses, either intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) or large for gestational age (LGA), demonstrate that these newborns are at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease in adulthood. There is growing evidence that the in utero environment leads to epigenetic modification, contributing to eventual risk of developing heart disease or diabetes. In this study, we used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing to examine genome-wide DNA methylation variation in placental samples from offspring born IUGR, LGA, and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and to identify differential methylation of genes important for conferring risk of cardiometabolic disease. We found that there were distinct methylation signatures for IUGR, LGA, and AGA groups and identified over 500 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) among these group comparisons. Functional and gene network analyses revealed expected relationships of DMGs to placental physiology and transport, but also identified novel pathways with biologic plausibility and potential clinical importance to cardiometabolic disease. Specific loci for DMGs of interest had methylation patterns that were strongly associated with anthropometric presentations. We further validated altered gene expression of these specific DMGs contributing to vascular and metabolic diseases (SLC36A1, PTPRN2, CASZ1, IL10), thereby establishing transcriptional effects toward assigning functional significance. Our results suggest that the gene expression and methylation state of the human placenta are related and sensitive to the intrauterine environment, as it affects fetal growth patterns. We speculate that these observed changes may affect risk for offspring in developing adult cardiometabolic disease.},

In the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, the inability of lung macrophages to successfully regulate the exaggerated inflammatory response suggests dysfunctional innate immune cell function. In this study, we aim to gain insight into innate immune cell dysfunction in CF by investigating alterations in DNA methylation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells, composed primarily of lung macrophages of CF subjects compared with healthy controls. All analyses were performed using primary alveolar macrophages from human subjects collected via bronchoalveolar lavage. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was examined via Illumina MethylationEPIC (850 K) array. Targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing was used to validate selected differentially methylated CpGs. Methylation-based sample classification was performed using the recursively partitioned mixture model (RPMM) and was tested against sample case-control status. Differentially methylated loci were identified by fitting linear models with adjustment of age, sex, estimated cell type proportions, and repeat measurement. Results: RPMM class membership was significantly associated with the CF disease status (P = 0.026). One hundred nine CpG loci were differentially methylated in CF BAL cells (all FDR {$\leq$} 0.1). The majority of differentially methylated loci in CF were hypo-methylated and found within non-promoter CpG islands as well as in putative enhancer regions and DNase hyper-sensitive regions. Conclusions: These results support a hypothesis that epigenetic changes, specifically DNA methylation at a multitude of gene loci in lung macrophages, may participate, at least in part, in driving dysfunctional innate immune cells in the CF lung.},

Epigenetic modification, such as DNA methylation, has been hypothesized to be an important mechanism that mediates certain biological processes and pathogenic effects of in utero phthalate exposure. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the association between genome-wide DNA methylation at birth and prenatal exposure to phthalate. Methods: We studied 64 infant\textendash mother pairs included in TMICS (Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study), a long-term follow-up birth cohort from the general population. DNA methylation levels at more than 450,000 CpG sites were measured in cord blood samples using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. The concentrations of three metabolites of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were measured using liquid chromatography tandem\textendash mass spectrometry (LC\textendash MS/MS) in urine samples collected from the pregnant women during 28\textendash 36 weeks gestation. Results: We identified 25 CpG sites whose methylation levels in cord blood were significantly correlated with prenatal DEHP exposure using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5\% (q-value {$<$} 0.05). Via gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we also found that there was significant enrichment of genes involved in the androgen response, estrogen response, and spermatogenesis within those genes showing DNA methylation changes in response to exposure. Specifically, PA2G4, HMGCR, and XRCC6 genes were involved in genes in response to androgen. Conclusions: Phthalate exposure in utero may cause significant alterations in the DNA methylation in cord blood. These changes in DNA methylation might serve as biomarkers of maternal exposure to phthalate in infancy and potential candidates for studying mechanisms via which phthalate may impact on health in later life. Future investigations are warranted.},

This approach was evaluated by mapping 1000 normally distributed phenotypes along chromosomes of varying length and marker density in a population size of 500. Experiment-wise signi\textregistered cance thresholds obtained from the simulation are compared to those calculated using the Bonferroni criterion and the newly developed measure of the eective number of independent tests in a genome scan. The Bonferroni calculation produced signi\textregistered cance thresholds very similar to those obtained by simulation. The threshold levels for both Bonferroni and simulation analysis depended strongly on the marker density and size of chromosomes. There was a slight bias of about 1\% in the thresholds obtained at the 5\% and 10\% point-wise signi\textregistered cance levels. The method introduced here provides a relatively simple correction for multiple comparisons that can be easily calculated using standard statistics packages.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concern over phthalates has emerged because of their potential toxicity to humans. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and children's intellectual functioning. METHODS: This study enrolled 667 children at nine elementary schools in five South Korean cities. A cross-sectional examination of urine phthalate concentrations was performed, and scores on neuropsychological tests were obtained from both the children and their mothers. RESULTS: We measured mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl)phthalate (MEOHP), both metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), a metabolite of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), in urine samples. The geometric mean (ln) concentrations of MEHP, MEOHP, and MBP were 21.3 microg/L [geometric SD (GSD) = 2.2 microg/L; range, 0.5-445.4], 18.0 microg/L (GSD = 2.4; range, 0.07-291.1), and 48.9 microg/L (GSD = 2.2; range, 2.1-1645.5), respectively. After adjusting for demographic and developmental covariates, the Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ scores were negatively associated with DEHP metabolites but not with DBP metabolites. We also found a significant negative relationship between the urine concentrations of the metabolites of DEHP and DBP and children's vocabulary subscores. After controlling for maternal IQ, a significant inverse relationship between DEHP metabolites and vocabulary subscale score remained. Among boys, we found a negative association between increasing MEHP phthalate concentrations and the sum of DEHP metabolite concentrations and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children vocabulary score; however, among girls, we found no significant association between these variables. CONCLUSION: Controlling for maternal IQ and other covariates, the results show an inverse relationship between phthalate metabolites and IQ scores; however, given the limitations in cross-sectional epidemiology, prospective studies are needed to fully explore these associations.},

Both ART and germline defects associated with parental infertility could interfere with epigenetic reprogramming events in germ cells or early embryos. Mouse models indicate that the placenta is more susceptible to the induction of epigenetic abnormalities than the embryo, and thus the placental methylome may provide a sensitive indicator of 'at risk' conceptuses. Our goal was to use genome-wide profiling to examine the extent of epigenetic abnormalities in matched placentas from an ART/infertility group and control singleton pregnancies (n~=~44/group) from a human prospective longitudinal birth cohort, the Design, Develop, Discover (3D) Study. Principal component analysis revealed a group of ART outliers. The ART outlier group was enriched for females and a subset of placentas showing loss of methylation of several imprinted genes including GNAS, SGCE, KCNQT1OT1 and BLCAP/NNAT. Within the ART group, placentas from pregnancies conceived with in vitro fertilization (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) showed distinct epigenetic profiles as compared to those conceived with less invasive procedures (ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination). Male factor infertility and paternal age further differentiated the IVF/ICSI group, suggesting an interaction of infertility and techniques in perturbing the placental epigenome. Together, the results suggest that the human placenta is sensitive to the induction of epigenetic defects by ART and/or infertility, and we stress the importance of considering both sex and paternal factors and that some but not all ART conceptuses will be susceptible.},

  abstract = {The use of human biomonitoring data to characterize exposure to environmental contaminants in epidemiology studies has expanded greatly in recent years. Substantial variability in effect measures may arise when using different exposure metrics for a given contaminant, and it is often not clear which metric is the best surrogate for the `causal' or `true' exposure. Here we evaluated variability and potential bias in epidemiologic associations resulting from the use of different phthalate exposure metrics in the 2009\textendash 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We examined associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and the outcomes of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). We examined each of the following NHANES-derived exposure metrics for metabolites of individual phthalates: molar excretion rate (nmol/min), molar amount (nmol), molar concentration (nmol/mL, with and without additional model adjustment for creatinine), creatinine corrected molar concentration (nmol/g creatinine), and reconstructed daily phthalate intake (nmol/kg/day). In order to investigate potential biasing effect of each metric, we first assumed that daily intake of the parent phthalate is the causal exposure. We then constructed a simulated population based on the 2009\textendash 2010 NHANES, and randomly assigned each individual a di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) intake dose based on a published distribution, but independent of any other factor. Accordingly, all associations between these randomly assigned intake doses and individuals' BMI and WC should be null. Next, demographic data in the NHANES were incorporated into a pharmacokinetic model to predict urinary molar excretions of five DEHP metabolites based on the randomly assigned DEHP intake. The predicted molar excretions were then used to calculate the same exposure metrics listed above. Three exposure metrics (randomly generated intake, excretion rate, urine concentration) showed no significant associations with BMI, which supports the null hypothesis stated above. In contrast, metrics adjusted for creatinine showed a significant negative correlation, and reconstructed daily intake showed a significant positive correlation, indicating the introduction of bias away from the true (i.e., null) association. Interestingly, trends in the simulation analysis were similar to those seen in the observed NHANES data. Our findings show that, at least in this example case, the choice of exposure metric can introduce significant bias of varying magnitude and direction into the calculation of epidemiologic associations.},

Two major areas of epigenetics\textemdash DNA methylation and histone modifications\textemdash are known to have profound effects on controlling gene expression. DNA methylation is involved in normal cellular control of expression, and aberrant hypermethylation can lead to silencing of tumor-suppressor genes in carcinogenesis. Histone modifications control the accessibility of the chromatin and transcriptional activities inside a cell. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules, {$\sim$}22 nucleotides long that can negatively control their target gene expression posttranscriptionally. There are currently more than 460 human miRNAs known, and the total number is predicted to be much larger. Recently, the expression of miRNAs has been definitively linked to cancer development, and miRNA profiles can be used to classify human cancers. miRNAs are encoded in our genome and are generally transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Despite the growing evidence for their importance in normal physiology, little is known about the regulation of miRNA expression. In this review, we will examine the relationship between miRNAs and epigenetics. We examine the effects of miRNAs on epigenetic machinery, and the control of miRNA expression by epigenetic mechanisms.

We applied EWAS to study semen quality and queried the sample size requirements to detect modest associations in a reproductive cohort. Study design and setting: We conducted 1) a multivariate EWAS of 128 endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) from 15 chemical classes measured in urine/serum relative to 7 semen quality endpoints in a prospective cohort study comprising 473 men and 2) estimated the sample size requirements for EWAS etiologic investigations. Results: None of the EDCs were associated with semen quality endpoints after adjusting for multiple tests. However, several EDCs (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl congeners 99, 105, 114, and 167) were associated with raw p {$<$} 0.05. In a post hoc statistical power analysis with the observed effect sizes, we determined that EWAS research in male fertility will require a mean sample size of 2696 men (1795\textendash 3625) to attain a power of 0.8. The average size of four published studies is 201 men. Conclusion: Existing cohort studies with hundreds of participants are underpowered ({$<$} 0.8) for EWAS-related investigations. Merging cohorts to ensure a sufficient sample size can facilitate the use of EWAS methods for assessing EDC mixtures that impact semen quality.},

  abstract = {Background:It has been estimated that a substantial portion of chronic and noncommunicable diseases can be caused or exacerbated by exposure to environmental chemicals. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that early life exposure to environmental chemicals at relatively low concentrations could have lasting effects on individual and population health. Although the potential adverse effects of environmental chemicals are known to the scientific community, regulatory agencies, and the public, little is known about the mechanistic basis by which these chemicals can induce long-term or transgenerational effects. To address this question, epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as the potential link between genetic and environmental factors of health and disease.Objectives:We present an overview of epigenetic regulation and a summary of reported evidence of environmental toxicants as epigenetic disruptors. We also discuss the advantages and challenges of using epigenetic biomarkers as an indicator of toxicant exposure, using measures that can be taken to improve risk assessment, and our perspectives on the future role of epigenetics in toxicology.Discussion:Until recently, efforts to apply epigenomic data in toxicology and risk assessment were restricted by an incomplete understanding of epigenomic variability across tissue types and populations. This is poised to change with the development of new tools and concerted efforts by researchers across disciplines that have led to a better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and comprehensive maps of epigenomic variation. With the foundations now in place, we foresee that unprecedented advancements will take place in the field in the coming years.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6104},

We investigated whether maternal circadian disruption, using night shift work as a proxy, is associated with variations in DNA methylation patterns of placental tissue in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of night shift work. Here, we compared cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide (CpG) specific methylation genome-wide of placental tissue (measured with the Illumina 450K array) from participants (n = 237) in the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS) who did (n = 53) and did not (n = 184) report working the night shift, using robust linear modeling and adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy smoking, infant sex, maternal adversity, and putative cell mixture. Statistical analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons and results presented with Bonferroni or Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) adjustment for false discovery rate. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation in placental tissue, including CpG sites in the genes NAV1, SMPD1, TAPBP, CLEC16A, DIP2C, FAM172A, and PLEKHG6 (Bonferroni-adjusted p{$<$}0.05). CpG sites within NAV1, MXRA8, GABRG1, PRDM16, WNT5A, and FOXG1 exhibited the most hypomethylation, while CpG sites within TDO2, ADAMTSL3, DLX2, and SERPINA1 exhibited the most hypermethylation (BH q{$<$}0.10). Functional analysis indicated GO-terms associated with cell-cell adhesion and enriched GWAS results for psoriasis. Night shift work was associated with differential methylation of the placenta, which may have implications for fetal health and development. This is the first study to examine the epigenetic impacts of night shift exposure, as a proxy for circadian disruption, on placental methylation in humans, and, while results should be interpreted with caution, suggests circadian disruption may have epigenetic impacts.},

These latter patients present broad methylation changes of two or more differentially methylated regions (DMR) that, when mimicking the paternal allele, raises the suspicious of the occurrence of paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 20 (upd(20)pat)., A cohort of 33 spor-PHP1B patients was screened for upd(20)pat using comparative genomic hybridization with SNP-chip. Methylation analyses were assessed by methylation specific-multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Upd(20)pat was identified in 6 patients, all exhibiting typical paternal methylation pattern compared to normal controls, namely a complete loss of methylation of GNAS A/B:TSS-DMR, negligible methylation at GNAS-AS1 :TSS-DMR and GNAS-XL:Ex1-DMR and complete gain of methylation at GNAS-NESP:TSS-DMR. The overall frequency of upd(20) is 18\% in our cohort when searched considering both severe and partial loss of imprinting. However, twenty five patients displayed severe methylation pattern and the upd(20)pat frequency reaches 24\% when searching in this group. Consequently, up to day, upd(20)pat is the most common anomaly than other genetic alterations in spor-PHP1B patients., Upd(20)pat occurrence is not linked to the parental age in contrast to upd(20)mat, strongly associated with an advanced maternal childbearing age., This study provides criteria to guide further investigations for upd(20)pat needed for an adequate genetic counseling.},

  abstract = {Perfluorinated acids, including perfluorinated carboxylates (PFCAs), and perfluorinated sulfonates (PFASs), are environmentally persistent and have been detected in a variety of wildlife across the globe. The most commonly detected PFAS, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), has been classified as a persistent and bioaccumulative substance. Similarities in chemical structure and environmental behavior of PFOS and the PFCAs that have been detected in wildlife have generated concerns about the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs. Differences between partitioning behavior of perfluorinated acids and persistent lipophilic compounds complicate the understanding of PFCA bioaccumulation and the subsequent classification of the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs according to existing regulatory criteria. Based on available research on the bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids, five key points are highlighted in this review: (1) bioconcentration and bioaccumulation of perfluorinated acids are directly related to the length of each compound's fluorinated carbon chain; (2) PFASs are more bioaccumulative than PFCAs of the same fluorinated carbon chain length; (3) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (perfluorooctanoate (PFO) and shorter PFCAs) are not considered bioaccumulative according to the range of promulgated bioaccumulation,"B", regulatory criteria of 1000-5000 L/kg; (4) PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less have low biomagnification potential in food webs, and (5) more research is necessary to fully characterize the bioaccumulation potential of PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains ({$>$}7 fluorinated carbons), as PFCAs with longer fluorinated carbon chains may exhibit partitioning behavior similar to or greater than PFOS. The bioaccumulation potential of perfluorinated acids with seven fluorinated carbons or less appears to be several orders of magnitude lower than "legacy" persistent lipophilic compounds classified as bioaccumulative. Thus, although many PFCAs are environmentally persistent and can be present at detectable concentrations in wildlife, it is clear that PFCAs with seven fluorinated carbons or less (including PFO) are not bioaccumulative according to regulatory criteria.},

  abstract = {This study was based on the hypothesis that IL-1{$\beta$} and its central regulator, the inflammasome, may play a role in the inflammatory condition exhibited by placental tissues from mothers with different gestational hyperglycemia levels. Pregnant women were classified according to the glycemic reference as non-diabetic (n = 15), mild gestational hyperglycemia (n = 15), gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 15) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 15). We investigated levels of pro-inflammatory factors in maternal plasma and placental tissues (by ELISA or immunohistochemistry) and, NFKB activity (by electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and inflammasome protein expression (by Western blot) in chorionic villous. Maternal plasma and placental levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, and MCP-1) were increased during all hyperglycemic conditions. Villous stroma cells showed strong immunoreactivity to CD68. In addition, with syncytiotrophoblast, the villous stroma cells were also stained to detect iNOS, MCP-1, TLR2, and TLR4. Although the levels of protein had fluctuated in the groups, NLRP1, NLRP3, ASC, and Caspase 1 were up-regulated in all hyperglycemic groups suggesting the inflammasome may be assembled in these pregnant women. The NFKB activity also exhibited higher levels in hyperglycemic groups, which might imply in pro-inflammatory cytokines production. In summary, increased maternal glucose levels during pregnancy changed systemic and placental inflammatory patterns, which occurred in parallel with the expression of inflammasome factors and processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1{$\beta$}. These results suggest an inflammatory condition in all gestational hyperglycemic conditions, even in hyperglycemia that is less severe than gestational or overt diabetes, likely associated with inflammasome activation and inflammatory cytokine secretion. Inflammasome activation as a possible source of inflammatory factors may be an important target to be considered while managing hyperglycemia and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

Methods NanoString technology was used to identify aberrant genes, comparing 39 women carrying a fetus with a congenital heart defect (CHD) to 31 controls at 19\textendash 24 weeks of gestation. The genes with differential expression were subsequently tested using real time polymerase chain reaction. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to combine all the mRNA species with discriminant ability for CHD. A multivariable receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve having the estimated discriminant score as an explanatory variable was generated. Results Six genes with differential expression, namely FALZ, PAPP-A, PRKACB, SAV1, STK4 and TNXB2, were found. The ROC curve yielded a detection rate of 66.7\% at a false positive rate of 10\%. A higher discriminant score ({$>$}75th centile) was reached for 14 CHD cases (82.4\%) and only 1 control (5.8\%). Two cases (11.8\%) of heart rhythm disorders also yielded a discriminant score value {$>$}75th centile. Conclusion These data represent a step forward in the screening of CHDs. Additional studies are needed to detect more mRNAs with discriminant ability and to move the first trimester screening.},

  abstract = {Background: Imprinted genes show expression from one parental allele only and are important for development and behaviour. This extreme mode of allelic imbalance has been described for approximately 56 human genes. Imprinting status is often disrupted in cancer and dysmorphic syndromes. More subtle variation of gene expression, that is not parent-of-origin specific, termed 'allele-specific gene expression' (ASE) is more common and may give rise to milder phenotypic differences. Using two allele-specific high-throughput technologies alongside bioinformatics predictions, normal term human placenta was screened to find new imprinted genes and to ascertain the extent of ASE in this tissue. Results: Twenty-three family trios of placental cDNA, placental genomic DNA (gDNA) and gDNA from both parents were tested for 130 candidate genes with the Sequenom MassArray system. Six genes were found differentially expressed but none imprinted. The Illumina ASE BeadArray platform was then used to test 1536 SNPs in 932 genes. The array was enriched for the human orthologues of 124 mouse candidate genes from bioinformatics predictions and 10 human candidate imprinted genes from EST database mining. After quality control pruning, a total of 261 informative SNPs (214 genes) remained for analysis. Imprinting with maternal expression was demonstrated for the lymphocyte imprinted gene ZNF331 in human placenta. Two potential differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found in the vicinity of ZNF331. None of the bioinformatically predicted candidates tested showed imprinting except for a skewed allelic expression in a parent-specific manner observed for PHACTR2, a neighbour of the imprinted PLAGL1 gene. ASE was detected for two or more individuals in 39 candidate genes (18\%). Conclusions: Both Sequenom and Illumina assays were sensitive enough to study imprinting and strong allelic bias. Previous bioinformatics approaches were not predictive of new imprinted genes in the human term placenta. ZNF331 is imprinted in human term placenta and might be a new ubiquitously imprinted gene, part of a primate-specific locus. Demonstration of partial imprinting of PHACTR2 calls for re-evaluation of the allelic pattern of expression for the PHACTR2-PLAGL1 locus. ASE was common in human term placenta.},

  abstract = {In this review, the sugar portions of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans constitute the glycome, and the genes involved in their biosynthesis, degradation, transport and recognition are referred to as ``glycogenes``. The extreme complexity of the glycome requires the regulatory layer to be provided by the epigenetic mechanisms. Almost all types of cancers present glycosylation aberrations, giving rise to phenotypic changes and to the expression of tumor markers. In this review, we discuss how cancer-associated alterations of promoter methylation, histone methylation/acetylation, and miRNAs determine glycomic changes associated with the malignant phenotype. Usually, increased promoter methylation and miRNA expression induce glycogene silencing. However, treatment with demethylating agents sometimes results in silencing, rather than in a reactivation of glycogenes, suggesting the involvement of distant methylation-dependent regulatory elements. From a therapeutic perspective aimed at the normalization of the malignant glycome, it appears that miRNA targeting of cancer-deranged glycogenes can be a more specific and promising approach than the use of drugs, which broad target methylation/acetylation. A very specific type of glycosylation, the addition of GlcNAc to serine or threonine (O-GlcNAc), is not only regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, but is an epigenetic modifier of histones and transcription factors. Thus, glycosylation is both under the control of epigenetic mechanisms and is an integral part of the epigenetic code.},

  abstract = {It has been established that the permeability of the human placenta increases with advancing gestation. Indirect evidence has also proposed that aquaporins (AQPs) may be involved in the regulation of placental water flow but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Five AQPs have been found in the human placenta and fetal membranes [AQP1, 3, 4, 8 and 9]. However, the physiological function(s) and the regulation of these proteins remain unknown. Emerging evidence has shown that human fetal membrane AQPs may have a role in intramembranous amniotic fluid water regulation and that alterations in their expression are related to polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios. In addition, we have observed a high expression of AQP3 and AQP9 in the apical membrane of the syncytiotrophoblast. Moreover, AQP9 was found to be increased in preeclamptic placentas, but it could not be related to its functionality for the transport of water and mannitol. However, a significant urea flux was seen. Since preeclampsia is not known to be associated with an altered water flux to the fetus we propose that AQP9 might not have a key role in water transport in human placenta, but a function in the energy metabolism or the urea uptake and elimination across the placenta. However, the role of AQP9 in human placenta is still speculative and needs further studies. Insulin, hCG, cAMP and CFTR have been found to be involved in the regulation of the molecular and functional expression of AQPs. Further insights into these mechanisms may clarify how water moves between the mother and the fetus.},

TCS is commonly detected in aquatic ecosystems, as it is only partially removed during the wastewater treatment process. Sorption, biodegradation and photolytic degradation mitigate the availability of TCS to aquatic biota; however the by-products such as methyltriclosan and other chlorinated phenols may be more resistant to degradation and have higher toxicity than the parent compound. The continuous exposure of aquatic organisms to TCS, coupled with its bioaccumulation potential, have led to detectable levels of the antimicrobial in a number of aquatic species. TCS has been also detected in breast milk, urine and plasma, with levels of TCS in the blood correlating with consumer use patterns of the antimicrobial. Mammalian systemic toxicity studies indicate that TCS is neither acutely toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, nor a developmental toxicant. Recently, however, concern has been raised over TCS's potential for endocrine disruption, as the antimicrobial has been shown to disrupt thyroid hormone homeostasis and possibly the reproductive axis. Moreover, there is strong evidence that aquatic species such as algae, invertebrates and certain types of fish are much more sensitive to TCS than mammals. TCS is highly toxic to algae and exerts reproductive and developmental effects in some fish. The potential for endocrine disruption and antibiotic cross-resistance highlights the importance of the judicious use of TCS, whereby the use of TCS should be limited to applications where it has been shown to be effective.},

We summarize here different approaches applied in the Data Mining and Machine Learning group at the GAW20 to integrate genome-wide genotype and methylation array data. Results: We provide a non-intimidating introduction to some frequently used methods to investigate highdimensional molecular data and compare the different approaches tried by group members: random forest, deep learning, cluster analysis, mixed models, and gene-set enrichment analysis. Group contributions were quite heterogeneous regarding investigated data sets (real vs simulated), conducted data quality control and assessed phenotypes (eg, metabolic syndrome vs relative differences of log-transformed triglyceride concentrations before and after fenofibrate treatment). However, some common technical issues were detected, leading to practical recommendations. Conclusions: Different sources of correlation were identified by group members, including population stratification, family structure, batch effects, linkage disequilibrium and correlation of methylation values at neighboring cytosinephosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, and the majority of applied approaches were able to take into account identified correlation structures. The ability to efficiently deal with high-dimensional omics data, and the model free nature of the approaches that did not require detailed model specifications were clearly recognized as the main strengths of applied methods. A limitation of random forest is its sensitivity to highly correlated variables. The parameter setup and the interpretation of results from deep learning methods, in particular deep neural networks, can be extremely challenging. Cluster analysis and mixed models may need some predimension reduction based on existing literature, data filtering, and supplementary statistical methods, and gene-set enrichment analysis requires biological insight.},

We introduce the exposome concept that, encompassing the totality of human environmental exposures to multiple risk factors, aims at explaining individual vulnerability and resilience to early chemical exposure. In this framework, we synthetically review the role of variable gene backgrounds, the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms as well as the function played by potential effect modifiers such as socioeconomic status. We describe laboratory rodent studies where the neurodevelopmental effects of environmental chemicals are assessed in the presence of either a ``vulnerable'' gene background or adverse pregnancy conditions (i.e., maternal stress). Finally, we discuss the need for more descriptive and ``lifelike'' experimental models of NDDs, to identify candidate biomarkers and pinpoint susceptible groups or life stages to be translated to large prospective studies within the exposome framework.},

Despite experience acquired from gene expression microarrays, analyzing Infinium Methylation arrays appeared more complex than initially thought and several difficulties have been encountered, as those arrays display specific features that need to be taken into consideration during data processing. Here, we review several issues that have been highlighted by the scientific community, and we present an overview of the general data processing scheme and an evaluation of the different normalization methods available to date to guide the 450K users in their analysis and data interpretation.},

  abstract = {Background: Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental compounds is known to possess endocrine disruption potentials. Bisphenol A has epigenetic effects as deregulated expression of microRNAs; such epigenetic marks can induce up/down alterations in gene expression that may persist throughout a lifetime. Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been documented in pregnant women, but consequences for development of offspring after BPA exposure during pregnancy are not yet widely studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain a comprehensive understanding of microRNAs changes in the placenta transcriptome from pregnant women subjected to therapeutic abortion for fetal malformation and correlate the impact of gestational exposure to BPA on these developmental changes. Methods: We performed a comparative analysis of genome wide miRNA expression in placentas from pregnant women exposed to BPA using microarray technology to identify miRNAs which were aberrantly expressed in placentas from malformed fetuses. The expression changes of differential expressed miRNAs in the samples used for microarray were confirmed by qPCR . Beside, we applied various bioinformatics tools to predict the target genes of the identified miR-146a and explore their biological function and downstream pathways. Results: We found that miR-146a was significant overexpressed and correlated significantly with BPA accumulation in the placenta from pregnant women living in a polluted area and undergoing therapeutic abortion due to fetal malformations. Beside, we applied various bioinformatics tools to predict the target genes of miR-146a and explore their biological function and downstream pathways. Conclusions: For the first time, we found, in humans, that miR-146a was significant over-expressed and correlated significantly with BPA accumulation in the placenta. Our results lead to the suggestion that miRNAs could be potential biomarkers to clarify the mechanisms of environmental diseases.},

Methods based on statistical tests that incorporate expression level variability are used more commonly than those based on fold change (FC). However, FC based results are more reproducible and biologically relevant. Results: We propose a new method based on fold change rank ordering statistics (FCROS). We exploit the variation in calculated FC levels using combinatorial pairs of biological conditions in the datasets. A statistic is associated with the ranks of the FC values for each gene, and the resulting probability is used to identify the DE genes within an error level. The FCROS method is deterministic, requires a low computational runtime and also solves the problem of multiple tests which usually arises with microarray datasets. Conclusion: We compared the performance of FCROS with those of other methods using synthetic and real microarray datasets. We found that FCROS is well suited for DE gene identification from noisy datasets when compared with existing FC based methods.},

  abstract = {Background Bisphenols and triclosan are considered as potential thyroid disruptors. While mild alterations in maternal thyroid function can result in adverse pregnancy and child developmental outcomes, there is still uncertainty whether bisphenols or triclosan can interfere with thyroid function during pregnancy. Objectives We aimed to investigate the association of urinary bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and triclosan with early pregnancy thyroid function. Methods This study was embedded in the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA), a population-based prospective pregnancy cohort. In total, 1996 participants were included in the current study. Maternal urinary concentrations of three bisphenols and triclosan, collected at median (95\% range) 10 (6\textendash 14) weeks of pregnancy as well as serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), total thyroxine (TT4), and total triiodothyronine (TT3) were measured. Results Higher BPA levels were associated with lower TT4 concentrations (non-monotonic, P = 0.03), a lower FT4/FT3 ratio ({$\beta$} [SE] -0.02 [0.01], P = 0.03) and a lower TT4/TT3 ratio ({$\beta$} [SE] -0.73 [0.27], P = 0.008). Higher BPF levels were associated with a higher FT3 ({$\beta$} [SE] 0.01 [0.007], P = 0.04). There were no associations between other bisphenols or triclosan and absolute TSH, (F)T4 or (F)T3 concentrations. The association of BPA with thyroid function differed with gestational age. The negative association of BPA with FT4/FT3 and TT4/TT3 ratios was only apparent in early but not late gestation (P for interaction: 0.003, 0.008, respectively). Conclusion These human data during pregnancy substantiate experimental findings suggesting that BPA could potentially affect thyroid function and deiodinase activities in early gestation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the third in a series illustrating the power of generalized linear models (GLMs) for the astronomical community, we elucidate the potential of the class of GLMs which handles count data. The size of a galaxy's globular cluster (GC) population (NGC) is a prolonged puzzle in the astronomical literature. It falls in the category of count data analysis, yet it is usually modelled as if it were a continuous response variable. We have developed a Bayesian negative binomial regression model to study the connection between NGC and the following galaxy properties: central black hole mass, dynamical bulge mass, bulge velocity dispersion and absolute visual magnitude. The methodology introduced herein naturally accounts for heteroscedasticity, intrinsic scatter, errors in measurements in both axes (either discrete or continuous) and allows modelling the population of GCs on their natural scale as a nonnegative integer variable. Prediction intervals of 99 per cent around the trend for expected NGC comfortably envelope the data, notably including the Milky Way, which has hitherto been considered a problematic outlier. Finally, we demonstrate how random intercept models can incorporate information of each particular galaxy morphological type. Bayesian variable selection methodology allows for automatically identifying galaxy types with different productions of GCs, suggesting that on average S0 galaxies have a GC population 35 per cent smaller than other types with similar brightness.},

In spite of widespread exposure to phenols, only few studies examined their effects on human development. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between antenatal phenol exposure and birth outcomes in a Chinese obstetric population. Four hundred ninety-six mother-infant pairs recruited from the Laizhou Wan prospective birth cohort in northern China between 2010 and 2013 were included in the study. We measured two phenol metabolites in maternal urine at delivery and examined their associations with birth outcomes including birth weight, crown\textendash heel length, head circumference, gestational age, and ponderal index. Median levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and triclosan (TCS) in urine were 1.07 and 0.50 {$\mu$}g/g creatinine, respectively. After adjusting for confounders, a 10-fold increase in BPA levels was associated with a 0.63 cm [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.25 to 1.01] increase in birth length among boys, but not among girls. No associations were found between TCS levels and any birth outcomes. The positive association of prenatal low-level BPA exposures with anthropometric measures observed among boys, suggests gender differences in the response to antenatal phenol exposure. Given the variability in urinary phenol levels reported during pregnancy, our findings based on levels of the target biomarkers in a single urine sample need to be confirmed in additional studies.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting refers to silencing of one parental allele in the zygotes of gametes depending upon the parent of origin. Loss of imprinting (LOI) is the gain of function from the silent allele that can have a maximum effect of doubling the gene dosage. LOI may play a significant role in the etiology of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Using placental tissue from ten normal and seven IUGR pregnancies, we conducted a systematic survey of the expression of a panel of 74 "putatively" imprinted genes using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that 52/74 ( approximately 70\%) of the genes were expressed in human placentas. Nine of the 52 (17\%) expressed genes were significantly differentially expressed between normal and IUGR placentas; five were upregulated (PHLDA2, ILK2, NNAT, CCDC86, PEG10) and four downregulated (PLAGL1, DHCR24, ZNF331, CDKAL1). We also assessed LOI profile of 14 imprinted genes in 14 normal and 24 IUGR placentas using a functional and sensitive assay developed in our laboratory. Little LOI was observed in any placentas for five of the genes (PEG10, PHLDA2, MEG3, EPS15, CD44). With the 149 heterozygosities examined, 40 (26.8\%) exhibited LOI {$>$}3\%. Some genes exhibited frequent LOI in placentas regardless of the disease status (IGF2, TP73, MEST, SLC22A18, PEG3), while others exhibited LOI only in IUGR placentas (PLAGL1, DLK1, H19, SNRPN). Importantly, there was no correlation between gene expression and LOI profile. Our study suggests that genomic imprinting may play a role in IUGR pathogenesis, but mechanisms other than LOI may contribute to dysregulation of imprinted genes.},

More than half of these DMRs have cell type-restricted ASM, and among them are 188 hap-ASM DMRs and 933 mQTLs located near GWAS signals for immune and neurological disorders. Targeted bis-seq confirmed hap-ASM in 12/13 loci tested, including CCDC155, CD69, FRMD1, IRF1, KBTBD11, and S100A({${_\ast}$})-ILF2, associated with immune phenotypes, MYT1L, PTPRN2, CMTM8 and CELF2, associated with neurological disorders, NGFR and HLA-DRB6, associated with both immunological and brain disorders, and ZFP57, a trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting. Polymorphic CTCF and transcription factor (TF) binding sites were over-represented among hap-ASM DMRs and mQTLs, and analysis of the human data, supplemented by cross-species comparisons to macaques, indicated that CTCF and TF binding likelihood predicts the strength and direction of the allelic methylation asymmetry. These results show that hap-ASM is highly tissue specific; an important trans-acting regulator of genomic imprinting is regulated by this phenomenon; and variation in CTCF and TF binding sites is an underlying mechanism, and maps of hap-ASM and mQTLs reveal regulatory sequences underlying supra- and sub-threshold GWAS peaks in immunological and neurological disorders.},

Cadmium (Cd) has been associated with smoking-related health effects, and its concentration in tobacco smoke is higher in comparison with other metals.Objectives:We studied the association of Cd and smoking exposures with human blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. We also evaluated the implication of findings to relevant methylation pathways and the potential contribution of Cd exposure from smoking to explain the association between smoking and site-specific DNAm.Methods:We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of urine Cd and self-reported smoking (current and former vs. never, and cumulative smoking dose) with blood DNAm in 790,026 CpGs (methylation sites) measured with the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC (Illumina Inc.) platform in 2,325 adults 45\textendash 74 years of age who participated in the Strong Heart Study in 1989\textendash 1991. In a mediation analysis, we estimated the amount of change in DNAm associated with smoking that can be independently attributed to increases in urine Cd concentrations from smoking. We also conducted enrichment analyses and in silico protein\textendash protein interaction networks to explore the biological relevance of the findings.Results:At a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected level of 0.05, we found 6 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for Cd; 288 and 17, respectively, for current and former smoking status; and 77 for cigarette pack-years. Enrichment analyses of these DMPs displayed enrichment of 58 and 6 Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene sets, respectively, including biological pathways for cancer and cardiovascular disease. In in silico protein-to-protein networks, we observed key proteins in DNAm pathways directly and indirectly connected to Cd- and smoking-DMPs. Among DMPs that were significant for both Cd and current smoking (annotated to PRSS23, AHRR, F2RL3, RARA, and 2q37.1), we found statistically significant contributions of Cd to smoking-related DNAm.Conclusions:Beyond replicating well-known smoking epigenetic signatures, we found novel DMPs related to smoking. Moreover, increases in smoking-related Cd exposure were associated with differential DNAm. Our integrative analysis supports a biological link for Cd and smoking-associated health effects, including the possibility that Cd is partly responsible for smoking toxicity through epigenetic changes.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6345},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is defined as an epigenetic modification that leads to parent-of-origin specific monoallelic expression. Some current research on the fetal control growth has been focused on the study of genes that display imprinted expression in utero. Four imprinted genes, two paternally expressed (IGF2 and PEG10) and two maternally expressed (PHLDA2 and CDKN1C), are well known to play a role in fetal growth and placental development. Pregnancy loss in the general reproductive population is a very common occurrence and other genetic causes beyond chromosomal abnormalities could be involved in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths, such as alteration of expression in imprinted genes particularly those related to fetal or placental growth. Quantitative Real Time PCR was performed to evaluate gene expressions patterns of the four mentioned genes in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths from 38 women. Expression levels of PHLDA2 gene were upregulated in the first trimester pregnancy cases and all four imprinted genes studied were upregulated in the second trimester of pregnancy cases comparing with controls. In third trimester PEG10 was downregulated in fetal samples group. This is the first study presenting data from human imprinted genes expression in spontaneous miscarriages or fetal deaths cases from the three trimesters of pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Summary: Illumina microarray is becoming a popular microarray platform. The BeadArray technology from Illumina makes its preprocessing and quality control different from other microarray technologies. Unfortunately, most other analyses have not taken advantage of the unique properties of the BeadArray system, and have just incorporated preprocessing methods originally designed for Affymetrix microarrays. lumi is a Bioconductor package especially designed to process the Illumina microarray data. It includes data input, quality control, variance stabilization, normalization and gene annotation portions. In specific, the lumi package includes a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) algorithm that takes advantage of the technical replicates available on every Illumina microarray. Different normalization method options and multiple quality control plots are provided in the package. To better annotate the Illumina data, a vendor independent nucleotide universal identifier (nuID) was devised to identify the probes of Illumina microarray. The nuID annotation packages and output of lumi processed results can be easily integrated with other Bioconductor packages to construct a statistical data analysis pipeline for Illumina data.},

Triclosan is widely used as an antibacterial agent and reported to transport across the placenta and affect embryonic development. Here, we used human embryonic stem cell- (hESC-) derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to determine the effects of TCS exposure on cardiac development. After TCS treatment, the differentiation process was significantly blocked and spontaneous beating rates of CMs were also decreased. Transcriptome analysis showed the dysregulation of genes involved in cardiogenesis, including GATA4 and TNNT2. Additionally, DNA methylation was also altered by TCS exposure, especially in those regions with GATA motif enrichment. These alterations of transcriptome and DNA methylation were all associated with signaling pathways integral to heart development. Our findings indicate that TCS exposure might cause cardiomyocyte differentiation toxicity and provide the new insights into how environmental factors regulate DNA methylation and gene expressions during heart development.},

The present study examines the hypothesis that a decrease in the synthesis of this protein in relation to certain polymorphisms of the regulatory region of the HSPA1A gene can define a vascular disease risk phenotype. A randomly selected population was studied and stratified into groups according to the degree of vascular risk. After applying the Task Force Chart to 452 people, the subjects were divided into three groups: group 0 (no vascular risk factor or risk\,{$<$}\,5\%), n\,=\,239; group 1 (moderate (10\textendash 20\%) risk, with no clinical cardiovascular disease), n\,=\,161; and group 2 (overt atherosclerosis), n\,=\,52. Serum and intragranulocytic HSPA1A was quantified, and direct Sanger sequencing was performed in all subjects. An analysis was made of the association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (db rs1008438 -110A/C and db rs1043618 +190~G/C) with circulating and intragranulocytic HSPA1A and the risk of atherosclerosis. The atherosclerotic subjects showed significantly lower circulating HSPA1A levels than the other groups, regardless of the genotype. The patients with CC genotype for both polymorphisms showed significantly lower intragranulocytic HSPA1A levels than the other genotypes. Serum HSPA1A concentrations could be proposed as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease. CC homozygosis for polymorphisms db rs1008438 and db rs1043618 is associated with a decrease in the intragranulocytic production of HSPA1A. Given the antiatherogenic functions of intracellular HSPA1A, the -110A and +190~G alleles could constitute potential genetic biomarkers of a less severe clinical phenotype for the risk of developing atherosclerosis.},

  abstract = {The placental microvasculature is essential for efficient transfer of gases, nutrients and waste between the mother and fetus. Microvascular hypoplasia of the terminal villi is a common pathology in severe Intra Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR). We used novel methods to obtain placental micro-vascular endothelial cells (PlMEC) from preterm control placentas (n~=~3) and placentas from pregnancies with severe IUGR (n~=~6) with absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity in the umbilical artery. Distal placental villous tissue was collected to enrich for intermediate and terminal villi. Tissue was digested and PlMEC positively selected using tocosylated magnetic Dynabeads labeled with Human Endothelial Antigen lectin. The purity of the PlMEC (94~{$\pm~$}2 SD \%) was assessed by CD31 and vimentin immunocytochemistry. RNA was extracted from the PlMEC samples and subjected to Affymetrix microarray analysis (U133Plus2 array chips). Comparison of preterm and IUGR PlMEC gene expression profiles identified BTNL9 and NTRK2 transcripts to be upregulated and SAA1 and SLAMF1 transcripts to be downregulated in all 6 IUGR cases relative to preterm controls. A third downregulated gene GNAS was identified to be near significance. Changes were demonstrated to be significant at the mRNA level by Real Time PCR in the PlMEC samples. Changes in the IUGR endothelium were confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemistry for the 3 with available antibodies. We used a tissue microarray constructed from an independent cohort of placental samples from severe IUGR (n~=~7), preeclamptic (n~=~7), preterm control (n~=~6) and term control (n~=~6) pregnancies. Results confirmed differential endothelial expression of BTNL9, NTRK2 and SLAMF1 in IUGR versus preterm and term samples. These studies are the first to characterize PlMEC gene expression profiles thus we have advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of placental micro-vascular pathophysiology in fetal growth restriction.},

Objective: To conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on the association between urinary phthalate concentrations and children's neurodevelopment. Methods: We searched electronic bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health, CAB abstracts, and ERIC) (1910 to February 21st, 2014); reference lists of included articles, and conference abstracts (American Psychiatric Association, American Academy of Neurology, and Pediatric Academic Societies). Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and extracted data. We included original studies reporting on the association between prenatal or childhood urinary phthalate metabolites, and cognitive and behavioral outcomes (e.g., IQ scores, BASC-2 scores or equivalent) in children 0\textendash 12 years of age. Results: Of 2804 abstracts screened, 11 original articles met our criteria for inclusion. Conclusions: A systematic review of the literature supports the contention that prenatal exposure phthalates is associated with adverse cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children, including lower IQ, and problems with attention, hyperactivity, and poorer social communication. Further research characterizing the associations between specific phthalate metabolites and children's neurodevelopmental outcomes is needed to support the development of mitigation strategies and enhance the development of appropriate health policy.},

OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to examine the association of prenatal phthalate exposure with behavior and executive functioning at 4-9 years of age. METHODS: The Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Study enrolled a multiethnic prenatal population in New York City between 1998 and 2002 (n = 404). Third-trimester maternal urines were collected and analyzed for phthalate metabolites. Children (n = 188, n = 365 visits) were assessed for cognitive and behavioral development between the ages of 4 and 9 years. RESULTS: In multivariate adjusted models, increased loge concentrations of low molecular weight (LMW) phthalate metabolites were associated with poorer scores on the aggression [beta = 1.24; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.15- 2.34], conduct problems (beta = 2.40; 95\% CI, 1.34-3.46), attention problems (beta = 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.16- 2.41), and depression (beta = 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.11-2.24) clinical scales; and externalizing problems (beta = 1.75; 95\% CI, 0.61-2.88) and behavioral symptom index (beta = 1.55; 95\% CI, 0.39-2.71) composite scales. Increased loge concentrations of LMW phthalates were also associated with poorer scores on the global executive composite index (beta = 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.09-2.36) and the emotional control scale (beta = 1.33; 95\% CI, 0.18- 2.49). CONCLUSION: Behavioral domains adversely associated with prenatal exposure to LMW phthalates in our study are commonly found to be affected in children clinically diagnosed with conduct or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.},

Prenatal exposure to phthalates has been linked with externalizing behaviors and executive functioning defects suggestive of an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) phenotype. OBJECTIVES: We undertook an investigation into whether prenatal exposure to phthalates was associated with clinically confirmed ADHD in a population-based nested case-control study of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort (MoBa) between the years 2003 and 2008. METHODS: Phthalate metabolites were measured in maternal urine collected at midpregnancy. Cases of ADHD (n=297) were obtained through linkage between MoBa and the Norwegian National Patient Registry. A random sample of controls (n=553) from the MoBa population was obtained. RESULTS: In multivariable adjusted coexposure models, the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites ({$\sum$}DEHP) was associated with a monotonically increasing risk of ADHD. Children of mothers in the highest quintile of {$\sum$}DEHP had almost three times the odds of an ADHD diagnosis as those in the lowest [OR=2.99 (95\% CI: 1.47, 5.49)]. When {$\sum$}DEHP was modeled as a log-linear (natural log) term, for each log-unit increase in exposure, the odds of ADHD increased by 47\% [OR=1.47 (95\% CI: 1.09, 1.94)]. We detected no significant modification by sex or mediation by prenatal maternal thyroid function or by preterm delivery. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based case-control study of clinical ADHD, maternal urinary concentrations of DEHP were monotonically associated with increased risk of ADHD. Additional research is needed to evaluate potential mechanisms linking phthalates to ADHD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2358.},

Data were analyzed using a regression model for interval-censored data, providing adjusted mean monthly differences in age at attaining the pubertal milestones according to intrauterine cumulative (weeks) and trimester-specific acetaminophen exposure. Our results suggested a tendency towards slightly earlier attainment of almost all studied markers of female pubertal development with increasing number of weeks of exposure (i.e., about 1.5\textendash 3 months earlier age at pubic hair, axillary hair, and acne development comparing unexposed with those prenatally exposed for more than 12 weeks).

METHODS: Participants from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study, a birth cohort study, included 360 singletons with maternal serum measures of p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDE. Psychomotor development and mental development were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: We found a approximately 2-point decrease in Psychomotor Developmental Index scores with each 10-fold increase in p,p'-DDT levels at 6 and 12 months (but not 24 months) and p,p'-DDE levels at 6 months only. We found no association with mental development at 6 months but a 2- to 3-point decrease in Mental Developmental Index scores for p,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDT at 12 and 24 months, corresponding to 7- to 10-point decreases across the exposure range. Even when mothers had substantial exposure, breastfeeding was usually associated positively with Bayley scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to DDT, and to a lesser extent DDE, was associated with neurodevelopmental delays during early childhood, although breastfeeding was found to be beneficial even among women with high levels of exposure.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are widely used in agriculture and homes. Animal studies suggest that even moderate doses are neurodevelopmental toxicants, but there are few studies in humans. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship of prenatal and child OP urinary metabolite levels with children's neurodevelopment. METHODS: Participating children were from a longitudinal birth cohort of primarily Latino farm-worker families in California. We measured six nonspecific dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites in maternal and child urine as well as metabolites specific to malathion (MDA) and chlorpyrifos (TCPy) in maternal urine. We examined their association with children's performance at 6 (n = 396), 12 (n = 395), and 24 (n = 372) months of age on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development [Mental Development (MDI) and Psychomotor Development (PDI) Indices] and mother's report on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (n = 356). RESULTS: Generally, pregnancy DAP levels were negatively associated with MDI, but child measures were positively associated. At 24 months of age, these associations reached statistical significance [per 10-fold increase in prenatal DAPs: beta = -3.5 points; 95\% confidence interval (CI), -6.6 to -0.5; child DAPs: beta = 2.4 points; 95\% CI, 0.5 to 4.2]. Neither prenatal nor child DAPs were associated with PDI or CBCL attention problems, but both prenatal and postnatal DAPs were associated with risk of pervasive developmental disorder [per 10-fold increase in prenatal DAPs: odds ratio (OR) = 2.3, p = 0.05; child DAPs OR = 1.7, p = 0.04]. MDA and TCPy were not associated with any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We report adverse associations of prenatal DAPs with mental development and pervasive developmental problems at 24 months of age. Results should be interpreted with caution given the observed positive relationship with postnatal DAPs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) detoxifies oxon derivatives of some organophosphate (OP) pesticides, and its genetic polymorphisms influence enzyme activity and quantity. We previously reported that maternal urinary concentrations of dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites, a marker of OP pesticide exposure, were related to poorer mental development and maternally reported symptoms consistent with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) in 2-year-olds participating in the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) study. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether PON1 genotypes and enzyme measurements were associated with child neurobehavioral development and whether PON1 modified the association of in utero exposure to OPs (as assessed by maternal DAPs) and neurobehavior. METHODS: We measured DAP concentrations in maternal urine during pregnancy, PON1{$_{192}$} and PON1{$_{-108}$} genotypes in mothers and children, and arylesterase (ARYase) and paraoxonase (POase) in maternal, cord, and 2-year-olds' blood. We assessed 353 2-year-olds on the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and queried their mothers on the Child Behavior Checklist to obtain a score for PDD. RESULTS: Children with the PON1(-108T) allele had poorer MDI scores and somewhat poorer PDI scores. Children were less likely to display PDD when they or their mothers had higher ARYase activity and when their mothers had higher POase activity. The association between DAPs and MDI scores was strongest in children with PON1(-108T) allele, but this and other interactions between DAPs and PON1 polymorphisms or enzymes were not significant. CONCLUSION: PON1 was associated with child neurobehavioral development, but additional research is needed to confirm whether it modifies the relation with in utero OP exposure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant that can accumulate in the placenta during pregnancy, where it may impair placental function and affect fetal development. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate Cd-associated variations in placental DNA methylation (DNAM) and associations with gene expression; we also aimed to identify novel pathways involved in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. METHODS: Using placental DNAM and Cd concentrations in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS, n = 343) and the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS, n = 141), we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) between Cd and DNAM, adjusting for tissue heterogeneity using a reference-free method. Cohort-specific results were aggregated via inverse variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis, and variably methylated CpGs were associated with gene expression. We then performed functional enrichment analysis and tests for associations between gene expression and birth size metrics. RESULTS: We identified 17 Cd-associated differentially methylated CpG sites with meta-analysis p-values {$<$}1 \texttimes{} 10-5, two of which were within a 5\% false discovery rate (FDR). DNAM levels at 9 of the 17 loci were associated with increased expression of 6 genes (5\% FDR): TNFAIP2, EXOC3L4, GAS7, SREBF1, ACOT7, and RORA. Higher placental expression of TNFAIP2 and ACOT7 and lower expression of RORA were associated with lower birth weight z-scores (p-values {$<$}0:05). CONCLUSION: Cd-associated differential DNAM and corresponding DNAM-expression associations were observed at loci involved in inflammatory signaling and cell growth. The expression levels of genes involved in inflammatory signaling (TNFAIP2, ACOT7, and RORA) were also associated with birth weight, suggesting a role for inflammatory processes in Cd-associated reproductive toxicity. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2192},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is evidence to suggest that the risk of asthma might be increased with exposure to paracetamol in the intrauterine environment, infancy, later childhood and adult life. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence from studies investigating the association between paracetamol use in pregnancy and childhood asthma. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken of studies reporting the association between paracetamol use in pregnancy and subsequent asthma in childhood. The primary outcome variable was wheeze in the last 12 months. For tabulated raw data, not adjusted for confounders, random effects odds ratios (OR) were pooled by the inverse variance weighted method. RESULTS: There were six studies identified that were included in the meta-analysis. The age of children studied ranged from 30 to 84 months. The pooled random effects OR for the risk of current wheeze in the children of women who were exposed to any paracetamol during any stage of pregnancy was 1.21 (95\% confidence interval 1.02-1.44). Features of the studies variably included an association with paracetamol use during all trimesters of pregnancy and an association with persistent asthma, severe asthma, and with atopy. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of paracetamol during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. More research is urgently required to determine the impact of paracetamol during pregnancy on the risk of wheezing in offspring so that appropriate public health recommendations can be made.},

OBJECTIVE: We performed mutually independent EWAS on transportation noise and air pollution exposures. METHODS: We used data from two time points of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) from 1,389 participants contributing 2,542 observations. We applied multiexposure linear mixed-effects regressions with participant-level random intercept to identify significant Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in relation to 1-y average aircraft, railway, and road traffic day-evening-night noise (Lden); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter {$<$} 2:5 lm (PM2:5). We performed candidate (CpG-based; cross-systemic phenotypes, combined into ``allostatic load'') and agnostic (DMR-based) pathway enrichment tests, and replicated previously reported air pollution EWAS signals. RESULTS: We found no statistically significant CpGs at false discovery rate {$<$} 0:05. However, 14, 48, 183, 8, and 71 DMRs independently associated with aircraft, railway, and road traffic Lden; NO2; and PM2:5, respectively, with minimally overlapping signals. Transportation Lden and air pollutants tendentially associated with decreased and increased methylation, respectively. We observed significant enrichment of candidate DNA methylation related to C-reactive protein and body mass index (aircraft, road traffic Lden, and PM2:5), renal function and ``allostatic load'' (all exposures). Agnostic functional networks related to cellular immunity, gene expression, cell growth/proliferation, cardiovascular, auditory, embryonic, and neurological systems development were enriched. We replicated increased methylation in cg08500171 (NO2) and decreased methylation in cg17629796 (PM2:5). CONCLUSIONS: Mutually independent DNA methylation was associated with source-specific transportation noise and air pollution exposures, with distinct and shared enrichments for pathways related to inflammation, cellular development, and immune responses. These findings contribute in clarifying the pathways linking these exposures and age-related diseases but need further confirmation in the context of mediation analyses. https://doi.org/ 10.1289/EHP6174},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior research reports inverse associations between maternal prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and mental and motor development in preschoolers. No study evaluated whether these associations persist into school age. METHODS: In a follow up of 328 inner-city mothers and their children, we measured prenatal urinary metabolites of di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate in late pregnancy. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition was administered at child age 7 years and evaluates four areas of cognitive function associated with overall intelligence quotient (IQ). RESULTS: Child full-scale IQ was inversely associated with prenatal urinary metabolite concentrations of DnBP and DiBP: b{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-2.69 (95\% confidence interval [CI]{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-4.33, -1.05) and b{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-2.69 (95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}-4.22, -1.16) per log unit increase. Among children of mothers with the highest versus lowest quartile DnBP and DiBP metabolite concentrations, IQ was 6.7 (95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1.9, 11.4) and 7.6 (95\% CI{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}3.2, 12.1) points lower, respectively. Associations were unchanged after control for cognition at age 3 years. Significant inverse associations were also seen between maternal prenatal metabolite concentrations of DnBP and DiBP and child processing speed, perceptual reasoning and working memory; DiBP and child verbal comprehension; and BBzP and child perceptual reasoning. CONCLUSION: Maternal prenatal urinary metabolite concentrations measured in late pregnancy of DnBP and DiBP are associated with deficits in children's intellectual development at age 7 years. Because phthalate exposures are ubiquitous and concentrations seen here within the range previously observed among general populations, results are of public health significance.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that toxicant exposure can alter DNA methylation profile, one of the main epigenetic mechanisms, particularly during embryogenesis when DNA methylation patterns are being established. In order to investigate the effects of the antibacterial agent Triclosan on DNA methylation and its correlation with gene expression, zebrafish embryos were exposed during 7 days postfertilization (starting at maximum 8-cells stage) to 50 and 100 mg/l, two conditions for which increased sensitivity and acclimation have been respectively reported. Although global DNA methylation was not significantly affected, a total of 171 differentially methylated fragments were identified by Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing. The majority of these fragments were found between the two exposed groups, reflecting dose-dependant specific responses. Gene ontology analysis revealed that pathways involved in TGF-b signaling were enriched in larvae exposed to 50 mg/l, while de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis functions were overrepresented in fish exposed to 100 mg/l. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed a positive correlation between mRNA levels and DNA methylation patterns in introns, together with significant alterations of the transcription of genes involved in nervous system development, transcriptional factors and histone methyltransferases. Overall this work provides evidence that Triclosan alters DNA methylation in zebrafish exposed during embryogenesis as well as related genes expression and proposes concentration specific modes of action. Further studies will investigate the possible long-term consequences of these alterations, i.e. latent defects associated with developmental exposure and transgenerational effects, and the possible implications in terms of fitness and adaptation to environmental pollutants.},

  abstract = {Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) is widely used as plasticizer in numerous kinds of products such as plastic packaging in food industries. There is a high risk of DBP exposure for human; it can easily migrate into the human bodies through food plastic packaging and be a potential hazard for human health. In this study the neurobehavioral effects of oral DBP for 14 days (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200~mg/kg) were investigated in mice, using open field, Y-maze, elevated plus maze, passive avoidance test, rotarod and grip strength test. The results showed that DBP could reduce total distance movement, impair memory function and induce anxiety in mice. Histological analysis (haematoxylin-eosin staining) also showed significant nuclei size reduction and condensation in dentate gyrus cells of the DBP treated mice. In conclusion oral DBP administration for 14 days may cause some neurobehavioral adverse effects in mice.},

  abstract = {Developmental exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to induce changes in DNA methylation in both mouse and human genic regions; however, the response in repetitive elements and transposons has not been explored. Here we present novel methodology to combine genomic DNA enrichment with RepeatMasker analysis on next-generation sequencing data to determine the effect of perinatal BPA exposure on repetitive DNA at the class, family, subfamily, and individual insertion level in both mouse and human samples. Mice were treated during gestation and lactation to BPA in chow at 0, 50, or 50,000 ng/g levels and total BPA was measured in stratified human fetal liver tissue samples as low (non-detect to 0.83 ng/g), medium (3.5 to 5.79 ng/g), or high (35.44 to 96.76 ng/g). Transposon methylation changes were evident in human classes, families, and subfamilies, with the medium group exhibiting hypomethylation compared to both high and low BPA groups. Mouse repeat classes, families, and subfamilies did not respond to BPA with significantly detectable differential DNA methylation. In human samples, 1251 individual transposon loci were detected as differentially methylated by BPA exposure, but only 19 were detected in mice. Of note, this approach recapitulated the discovery of a previously known mouse environmentally labile metastable epiallele, CabpIAP. Thus, by querying repetitive DNA in both mouse and humans, we report the first known transposons in humans that respond to perinatal BPA exposure.},

This methods chapter is written with such individuals in mind. Although the majority of examples are drawn from the field of Caenorhabditis elegans biology, the concepts and practical applications are also relevant to those who work in the disciplines of molecular genetics and cell and developmental biology. Our intent has been to limit theoretical considerations to a necessary minimum and to use common examples as illustrations for statistical analysis. Our chapter includes a description of basic terms and central concepts and also contains in-depth discussions on the analysis of means, proportions, ratios, probabilities, and correlations.

Recently published epidemiological studies suggested a possible association between paracetamol exposure in utero and attention-deficit\textendash hyperactivity disorder/hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD/HKD) or adverse development issues in children. However, the effects observed are in the weak to moderate range, and limitations in the studies' design prevent inference on a causal association with ADHD/HKD or child neurological development. In parallel, recent animal data showed that cognition and behaviour may be altered following exposure to therapeutic doses of paracetamol during early development. These effects may be mediated by interference of paracetamol with brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotransmitter systems (including serotonergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, as well as the endogenous endocannabinoid systems), or cyclooxygenase-2. However, no firm conclusion can be made on the relevance of these observations to humans. We conclude that additional well-designed cohort studies are necessary to confirm or disprove the association. In the context of current knowledge, paracetamol is still to be considered safe in pregnancy and should remain the first-line treatment for pain and fever.},

  abstract = {Objective Potential neurotoxic effects of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have been reported in highly exposed animals, but whether these chemicals are neurotoxic in humans is not known. We therefore investigated whether prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), two of the most prevalent PFCs, are associated with behavioral or coordination problems in early childhood. Methods We used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, which enrolled mothers in early pregnancy, and we measured maternal blood levels of PFOA and PFOS using specimens drawn around 8 weeks of gestation. When the children reached 7 years of age, mothers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, n = 787) and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ, n = 526) to assess behavioral health and motor coordination of their children. SDQ scores above the 90th percentile were a priori defined to identify behavioral problems and DCDQ scores below the 10th percentile were defined as a potential DCD. Results The median concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in maternal blood were 34.4 ng/mL [interquartile range (IQR), 26.6\textendash 44.5] and 5.4 ng/mL (IQR, 4.0\textendash 7.1), respectively, similar to distributions reported for populations without occupational exposure. We found no association between higher SDQ scores and maternal levels of PFOS or PFOA, nor did we see any statistically significant association with motor coordination disorders. Conclusion The findings suggest that background levels of PFOA and PFOS are not associated with behavioral and motor coordination problems in childhood. However, effects on other developmental end points, including cognitive, attentional, and clinical mental disorders not measured in this study, cannot be ruled out.},

They have been found to interfere with fetal growth in some animal models, but whether a similar effect is seen in humans is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the association between plasma levels of PFOS and PFOA in pregnant women and their infants' birth weight and length of gestation. METHODS: We randomly selected 1,400 women and their infants from the Danish National Birth Cohort among those who completed all four computer-assisted telephone interviews, provided the first blood samples between gestational weeks 4 and 14, and who gave birth to a single live-born child without congenital malformation. PFOS and PFOA were measured by high performance liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometer. RESULTS: PFOS and PFOA levels in maternal plasma were on average 35.3 and 5.6 ng/mL, respectively. Only PFOA levels were inversely associated with birth weight (adjusted {$\beta$} = \textendash 10.63 g; 95\% confidence interval, \textendash 20.79 to \textendash 0.47 g). Neither maternal PFOS nor PFOA levels were consistently associated with the risk for preterm birth or low birth weight. We observed no adverse effects for maternal PFOS or PFOA levels on small for gestational age. CONCLUSION: Our nationwide cohort data suggest an inverse association between maternal plasma PFOA levels and birth weight. Because of widespread exposure to these chemicals, our findings may be of potential public health concern.},

  abstract = {Background Maternal exposure to environmental phenols is common in pregnancy and has been linked to preterm birth, preeclampsia, and reduced fetal growth. One potential mechanism may be through increased maternal oxidative stress. Objective We examined the associations between a panel of 10 urinary phenols, including dichlorophenols, benzophenone-3, parabens, triclosan and triclocarban, and bisphenol-S, and two urinary oxidative stress biomarkers, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-isoprostane. All exposure and outcome biomarkers were measured at 4 time points in pregnancy. Methods We used repeated measures models to examine the association between repeated exposure and outcome biomarkers. Additionally, we used adaptive elastic net (AENET) to identify non-null associations accounting for the correlation structure of exposures, both for phenols and urinary phthalate metabolites that were previously associated with the oxidative stress biomarkers in our study population. Results In adjusted repeated measures models, we observed that dichlorophenols, benzophenone-3, triclosan, and some parabens were associated with increases in both oxidative stress biomarkers. The greatest effect estimates were observed for 2,5-dichlorophenol; an interquartile range (IQR) increase in this compound was associated with a 15.2\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 11.0, 19.6) increase in 8-OHdG and a 16.7\% (95\% CI = 9.66, 24.2) increase in 8-isoprostane. Bisphenol-S detection was associated with a clear increase in 8-isoprostane (18.5\%, 95\% CI = 7.68, 30.5) but a more modest increase in 8-OHdG (6.18\%, 95\% CI = -0.27, 13.1). However, AENET models did not consistently select any of the phenols as predictors of 8-OHdG or 8-isoprostane when phthalate metabolites were included in the model. Conclusion Overall, urinary phenols were associated with increases in biomarkers of oxidative stress in pregnancy but either to a lesser extent, or due to correlation with, urinary phthalate metabolites.},

Many consortia have now datasets coming from both arrays and aspire to analyze the two together. The placenta shows a high number of intermediate methylation levels and is often investigated for obstetric/birth outcomes, and potentially for long-term programming in offspring. We performed a systematic comparison between the two arrays using 108 duplicate placental samples from Gen3G birth cohort. We find that placenta shows a high per-sample correlation between the arrays, and higher median correlations at individual CpGs than those reported for blood. We identify 26,340 probes with absolute difference in per cent methylation {$>$}10\%. We conclude that EPIC and 450K placental data can be combined, and we provide two lists of CpGs that should be excluded to avoid misleading results.},

  abstract = {Objectives Famine exposure in utero can `programme' an individual towards type 2 diabetes and obesity in later life. We sought to identify, (1) whether Bangladeshis exposed to famine during developmental life are programmed towards diabetes and obesity, (2) whether this programming was specific to gestational or postnatal exposure windows and (3) whether epigenetic differences were associated with famine exposure. Design A historical cohort study was performed as part of a wider cross-sectional survey. Exposure to famine was defined through birth date and historical records and participants were selected according to: (A) exposure to famine in postnatal life, (B) exposure to famine during gestation and (C) unexposed. Setting Matlab, a rural area in the Chittagong division of Bangladesh. Participants Young adult men and women (n=190) recruited to a historical cohort study with a randomised subsample included in an epigenetic study (n=143). Outcome measures Primary outcome measures of weight, body mass index and oral glucose tolerance tests (0 and 120 min glucose). Secondary outcome measures included DNA methylation using genome-wide and targeted analysis of metastable epialleles sensitive to maternal nutrition. Results More young adults exposed to famine in gestation were underweight than those postnatally exposed or unexposed. In contrast, more young adults exposed to famine postnatally were overweight compared to those gestationally exposed or unexposed. Underweight adults exposed to famine in gestation in utero were hyperglycaemic following a glucose tolerance test, and those exposed postnatally had elevated fasting glucose, compared to those unexposed. Significant differences in DNA methylation at seven metastable epialleles (VTRNA2-1, PAX8, PRDM-9, near ZFP57, near BOLA, EXD3) known to vary with gestational famine exposure were identified. Conclusions Famine exposure in developmental life programmed Bangladeshi offspring towards diabetes and obesity in adulthood but gestational and postnatal windows of exposure had variable effects on phenotype. DNA methylation differences were replicated at previously identified metastable epialleles sensitive to periconceptual famine exposure.},

  abstract = {Pericentric heterochromatin (PCH) is a particular form of constitutive heterochromatin that is localized to both sides of centromeres and that forms silent compartments enriched in repressive marks. These genomic regions contain species-specific repetitive satellite DNA that differs in terms of nucleotide sequences and repeat lengths. In spite of this sequence diversity, PCH is involved in many biological phenomena that are conserved among species, including centromere function, the preservation of genome integrity, the suppression of spurious recombination during meiosis, and the organization of genomic silent compartments in the nucleus. PCH organization and maintenance of its repressive state is tightly regulated by a plethora of factors, including enzymes (e.g., DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases), DNA and histone methylation binding factors (e.g., MECP2 and HP1), chromatin remodeling proteins (e.g., ATRX and DAXX), and non-coding RNAs. This evidence helps us to understand how PCH organization is crucial for genome integrity. It then follows that alterations to the molecular signature of PCH might contribute to the onset of many genetic pathologies and to cancer progression. Here, we describe the most recent updates on the molecular mechanisms known to underlie PCH organization and function.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 is a key component of the innate immune response to viral infection. The present study firstly examined whether sex differences exist in TLR3-induced inflammatory, endocrine, and sickness responses. The data revealed that TLR3-induced expression of interferon- or NFkB-inducible genes (IFN-{$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}, IP-10, or TNF-{$\alpha$}), either peripherally (spleen) or centrally (hypothalamus), did not differ between male and female rats, with the exception of TLR3-induced IFN-{$\alpha$} expression in the spleen of female, but not male, rats 8 hr post TLR3 activation. Furthermore, TLR3 activation increased plasma corticosterone levels, induced fever, and reduced locomotor activity and body weight - effects independent of sex. Thus, the acute-phase inflammatory, endocrine, and sickness responses to TLR3 activation exhibit minimal sex-related differences. A further aim of this study was to examine whether enhancing endocannabinoid tone - namely, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) or N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA), exhibited similar effects on TLR3-induced inflammatory responses in male versus female rats. Systemic administration of the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor MJN110 and subsequent increases in 2-AG levels did not alter the TLR3-induced increase in IP-10, IRF7, or TNF-{$\alpha$} expression in the spleen or the hypothalamus of male or female rats. In contrast, the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 increased levels of AEA and related N-acylethanolamines, an effect associated with the attenuation of TLR3-induced inflammatory responses in the hypothalamus, but not the spleen, of male and female rats. These data support a role for FAAH, but not MAGL, substrates in the modulation of TLR3-induced neuroinflammatory responses, effects independent of sex.},

  abstract = {Pesticides are commonly used in tropical regions such as the Caribbean for both household and agricultural purposes. Of particular concern is exposure during pregnancy, as these compounds can cross the placental barrier and interfere with fetal development. The objective of this study was to evaluate exposure of pregnant women residing in 10 Caribbean countries to the following commonly used classes of pesticides in the Caribbean: organophosphates (OPs), carbamates, phenoxy acids, and chlorophenols. Out of 438 urine samples collected, 15 samples were randomly selected from each Caribbean country giving a total of 150 samples. Samples were analyzed for the following metabolites: six OP dialkylphosphate metabolites [dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP), diethylphosphate (DEP), diethylthiophosphate (DETP) and diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP)]; two carbamate metabolites [2-isopropoxyphenol (2-IPP) and carbofuranphenol]; one phenoxy acid 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D); and five chlorophenols [2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP), 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP), 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP), and pentachlorophenol (PCP)]. OP metabolites were consistently detected in {$\geq$}60\% of the samples from Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, and Jamaica. Of the carbamate metabolites, 2-IPP was detected in seven of the 10 Caribbean countries with a detection frequency around 30\%, whereas carbofuranphenol was detected in only one sample. The detection frequency for the phenoxy acid 2,4-D ranged from 20\% in Grenada to a maximum of 67\% in Belize. Evidence of exposure to chlorophenol pesticides was also established with 2,4-DCP by geometric means ranging from 0.52 {$\mu$}g L(-1) in St Lucia to a maximum of 1.68 {$\mu$}g L(-1) in Bermuda. Several extreme concentrations of 2,5-DCP were detected in four Caribbean countries-Belize (1100 {$\mu$}g L(-1)), Bermuda (870 {$\mu$}g L(-1)), Jamaica (1300 {$\mu$}g L(-1)), and St Kitts and Nevis (1400 {$\mu$}g L(-1)). 2,4,5-TCP, 2,4,6-TCP, and pentachlorophenol were rarely detected. This biomonitoring study underscores the need for Caribbean public health authorities to encourage their populations, and in particular pregnant women, to become more aware of the potential routes of exposure to pesticides and to utilize these chemicals more cautiously given the possible adverse effects such exposures can have on their unborn children and infants.},

  abstract = {Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have focused primarily on DNA methylation as a chemically stable and functional epigenetic modification. However, the stability and accuracy of the measurement of methylation in different tissues and extraction types is still being actively studied, and the longitudinal stability of DNA methylation in commonly studied peripheral tissues is of great interest. Here, we used data from two studies, three tissue types, and multiple time points to assess the stability of DNA methylation measured with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Redundancy analysis enabled visual assessment of agreement of replicate samples overall and showed good agreement after removing effects of tissue type, age, and sex. At the probe level, analysis of variance contrasts separating technical and biological replicates clearly showed better agreement between technical replicates versus longitudinal samples, and suggested increased stability for buccal cells versus blood or blood spots. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) demonstrated that inter-individual variability is of similar magnitude to within-sample variability at many probes; however, as inter-individual variability increased, so did ICC. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate decreasing agreement in methylation levels with time, despite a maximal sampling interval of only 576 days. Finally, at 6 popular candidate genes, there was a large range of stability across probes. Our findings highlight important sources of technical and biological variation in DNA methylation across different tissues over time. These data will help to inform longitudinal sampling strategies of future EWAS.},

Behavioral development was assessed using the infant-toddler symptom checklist (ITSC) at 12 and at 24 months. Weighted logistic regression and weighted negative binomial regression models were applied to analyze the associations between PFASs and ASQ-II and ITSC, respectively. The median concentration of PFOS was 110 ng/L, while the median for PFOA was 40 ng/L. We did not detect an increased risk of having an abnormal score in ASQ-II at 6 months or 24 months. Moreover, no consistent increase in behavioral problems assessed at 12 and 24 months by ITSC questionnaire was detected. We observed no association between perinatal PFOS and PFOA exposure and early neuropsychological development.

Objectives: Our goal was to evaluate potential neurotoxic effects of prenatal exposure to seven metals (cobalt, copper, arsenic, cadmium, antimony, thallium and lead), during the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, on child neuropsychological development at 4 years of age. Materials and methods: This study was based on a population-based birth cohort established in Sabadell (Catalonia, Spain) as part of the INMA [Environment and Childhood] Project. Metals were measured in 485 urine samples collected from mothers during the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We assessed the neuropsychological development of 553 4-year-olds with the McCarthy Scales of Childrens' Abilitites (MSCA), together with their ADHD symptomatology, using the ADHD-DSM-IV criteria. A total of 385 children were included in the present study. Results: We found no statistically significant associations between metals and general cognitive scale or executive function of the MSCA. We found negative coefficients for the exposure to cadmium 1st trimester, cadmium 3rd trimester and lead 3rd trimester on the general cognitive score of MSCA, although these results were not significant. We did not find any association between prenatal exposure to metals and ADHD symptomatology at the age of 4 years. Conclusions: Our results do not suggest that prenatal exposure to current low-levels of metals impairs children's cognitive development during preschool years.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the association between postnatal exposure to multiple persistent organic pollutants (POPs) measured in breast milk samples and early behavioral problems using statistical methods to deal with correlated exposure data. METHODS: We used data from the Norwegian HUMIS study. We measured concentrations of 24 different POPs in human milk from 612 mothers (median collection time: 32 days after delivery), including 13 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) congeners, 6 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) congeners and five organochlorine compounds. We assessed child behavioral problems at 12 and 24 months using the infant toddler symptom checklist (ITSC). Higher score in ITSC corresponds to more behavioral problems. First we performed principal component analysis (PCA). Then two variable selection methods, elastic net (ENET) and Bayesian model averaging (BMA), were applied to select any toxicants associated with behavioral problems. Finally, the effect size of the selected toxicants was estimated using multivariate linear regression analyses. RESULTS: p,p'-DDT was associated with behavioral problems at 12 months in all the applied models. Specifically, the principal component composed of organochlorine pesticides was significantly associated with behavioral problems and both ENET and BMA identified p,p'-DDT as associated with behavioral problems. Using a multiple linear regression model an interquartile increase in p,p'-DDT was associated with a 0.62 unit increase in ITSC score (95\% CI 0.45, 0.79) at 12 months, corresponding to more behavioral problems. The association was modified by maternal education: the effect of p,p'-DDT was strongest in women with lower education ({$\beta$}=0.59; 95\%CI: 0.38, 0.81) compared to the mother with higher education ({$\beta$}=0.14; 95\%CI: -0.05, 0.34) (p-value for interaction=0.089). At 24 months, neither selection method consistently identified any toxicant associated with behavioral problems. CONCLUSION: Within a mixture of 24 toxicants measured in breast milk, p,p'-DDT was the single toxicant associated with behavioral problems at 12 months using different methods for handling numerous correlated exposures.},

  abstract = {Methods: Air pollution concentrations (nitrogen dioxide [NO2] and particulate matter [PM]) were estimated at the birth address by landuse regression models based on monitoring campaigns performed between 2008 and 2011. We extrapolated concentrations back in time to exact pregnancy periods. Teachers or parents assessed ADHD symptoms at 3\textendash 10 years of age. We classified children as having ADHD symptoms within the borderline/clinical range and within the clinical range using validated cutoffs. We combined all adjusted area-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analysis and multiple imputations and applied inverse probability-weighting methods to correct for loss to follow-up. Results: We classified a total of 2,801 children as having ADHD symptoms within the borderline/clinical range, and 1,590 within the clinical range. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy was not associated with a higher odds of ADHD symptoms within the borderline/clinical range (e.g., adjusted odds ratio [OR] for ADHD symptoms of 0.95, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.89, 1.01 per 10 \textmu g/m3 increase in NO2 and 0.98, 95\% CI = 0.80, 1.19 per 5 \textmu g/ m3 increase in PM2.5). We observed similar associations for ADHD within the clinical range. Conclusions:There wasno evidence for an increase in risk ofADHD symptoms with increasing prenatal air pollution levels in children aged 3\textendash 10 years.

In addition, these versatile proteins also regulate cell differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis in several cell types, and when mutated or disregulated significantly contribute to susceptibility to and progression of several cancers. IRF-1 is the most versatile member of the family, not essential for IFN gene expression and implicated in a variety of cellular functions spanning from the development and function of various immune cells to tumor suppression activity. IRF-3, IRF-7 and Irf-9 are more specifically involved in IFN induction and antiviral responses while IRF-5 is the regulator of inflammatory cytokines expression downstream pattern recognition receptors and IRF-6 is implicated in epithelial differentiation. IRF-8 as IRF-1 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, while IRF-2 and IRF-4 have generally oncogenic activity.},

  abstract = {Developmental exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) and other phenolic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may affect child neurodevelopment, but data on the effects of prenatal exposure to phenols on cognitive function remain sparse. Our aim was to examine the association of placental concentrations of several phenolic EDCs, including BPA, parabens (PBs), and benzophenones (BzPs), with cognitive development in preschool children from the Environment and Childhood (INMA) Project in Spain. Concentrations of BPA, four PBs (methylparaben [MePB], ethylparaben [EtPB], propylparaben [PrPB], and butylparaben [BuPB]), and six BzPs (BzP-1, BzP-2, BzP-3, BzP-6, BzP-8, and 4-hydroxybenzophenone [4-OH-BzP]) were measured in 490 placenta samples randomly selected from five INMA cohorts collected between 2000 and 2008. Neuropsychological assessment of cognitive and motor function was performed with the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) at the age of 4\textendash 5 years. Associations were assessed in a sub-sample of 191 mother-child pairs using linear and logistic regression models adjusted for confounding factors. PB compounds were detected in more than 71\% of placentas, BPA in 62\%, 4-OH-BzP in 50\%, and the remaining BzPs in {$<$}9\% of the samples. Because of the low detection frequency of BzP compounds, only 4-OH-BzP was included in the exposure-outcome analyses. After adjustment for confounders, BPA was associated with greater odds of scoring lower (below the 20th percentile) in the verbal (third vs. first exposure tertile: odds ratio [OR]~=~2.78, 95\% confidence interval [CI]~=~1.00; 5.81, p-trend~=~0.05) and gross motor (detected vs. undetected: OR~=~1.75, 95\%CI~=~1.06; 9.29) areas, and these associations were only significant for boys. Regarding PB compounds, PrPB was associated with lower scores in memory (detected vs. undetected: {$\beta~$}=~-4.96, 95\%CI~=~-9.54; -0.31), span memory (OR~=~2.50, 95\%CI~=~0.95; 6.92 and 2.71, 95\%CI~=~0.97; 6.64, respectively for second and third tertiles, p-trend~=~0.03), and motor function ({$\beta~$}=~-5.15, 95\%CI~=~-9.26; -0.01 for third vs. first exposure tertile, p-trend~=~0.04). EtPB and total PBs concentrations in the second tertile were also associated with poorer visual function of posterior cortex and worse quantitative performance, respectively, but linear trends were not statistically significant. The associations of BPA and PrPB with poorer verbal, memory, and motor skills are novel observations that warrant further attention. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm whether prenatal exposure to BPA and other phenolic EDCs is associated with impaired cognitive development.},

Although considered to be a highly familial disorder, ADHD heritability estimates of 60\% to 80\% highlight the considerable role that environmental factors may still play in disorder susceptibility. Proposed ADHD environmental risk factors include prenatal substance exposures, heavy metal and chemical exposures, nutritional factors, and lifestyle/psychosocial factors. This paper reviews the literature published in 2010 investigating the association between environmental risk factors and ADHD or related symptomatology. Sources of risk factor exposure and the proposed mechanism by which each exposure is linked to ADHD-related neurobehavioral changes are also reported. Methodologic limitations of the current literature are discussed, and guidelines for future study are proposed. An improved understanding of the role that environmental factors play in ADHD etiology is critical to future ADHD prevention efforts.},

  abstract = {As a field of study, genomic imprinting has grown rapidly in the last 20 years, with a growing figure of around 100 imprinted genes known in the mouse and approximately 50 in the human. The imprinted expression of genes may be transient and highly tissue-specific, and there are potentially hundreds of other, as yet undiscovered, imprinted transcripts. The placenta is notable amongst mammalian organs for its high and prolific expression of imprinted genes. This review discusses the development of the human placenta and focuses on the function of imprinting in this organ. Imprinting is potentially a mechanism to balance parental resource allocation and it plays an important role in growth. The placenta, as the interface between mother and fetus, is central to prenatal growth control. The expression of genes subject to parental allelic expression bias has, over the years, been shown to be essential for the normal development and physiology of the placenta. In this review we also discuss the significance of genes that lack conservation of imprinting between mice and humans, genes whose imprinted expression is often placentalspecific. Finally, we illustrate the importance of imprinting in the postnatal human in terms of several human imprinting disorders, with consideration of the brain as a key organ for imprinted gene expression after birth.},

  abstract = {Numerous researches have been carried out to explain the relationship between the count data y and numbers of covariates x through a generalized linear model (GLM). This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian LASSO solution using six different prior models to the negative binomial regression. Latent variables Z have been introduced to simplify the GLM to a standard linear regression model. The proposed models regard two conjugate zero-mean Normal priors for the regression parameters and three independent priors for the variance: the Exponential, Inverse-Gamma and Scaled Inverse-{$\chi$}2 distributions. Different types of priors result in different amounts of shrinkage. A Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs algorithm is used to compute the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest through a data augmentation process. Based on the posterior samples, an original Double Likelihood Ratio Test (DLRT) statistic have been proposed to choose the most relevant covariates and shrink the insignificant coefficients to zero. Numerical experiments on a real-life data set prove that Bayesian LASSO methods achieved significantly better predictive accuracy and robustness than the classical maximum likelihood estimation and the standard Bayesian inference.},

Cu homeostasis is tightly regulated through a complex system of Cu transporters and chaperone proteins. Excess or toxicity of Cu, which is associated with the pathogenesis of hepatic disorder, neurodegenerative changes and other disease conditions, can occur when Cu homeostasis is disrupted. The capacity to initiate oxidative damage is most commonly attributed to Cu-induced cellular toxicity. Recently, altered cellular events, including lipid metabolism, gene expression, alpha-synuclein aggregation, activation of acidic sphingomyelinase and release of ceramide, and temporal and spatial distribution of Cu in hepatocytes, as well as Cu-protein interaction in the nerve system, have been suggested to play a role in Cu toxicity. However, whether these changes are independent of, or secondary to, an altered cellular redox state of Cu remain to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to derive the multiple testing threshold when hypothesis tests are conducted using a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Permutation tests are considered the gold standard in multiple testing adjustment in genetic association studies. However, it is computationally intensive, especially for GWASs, and can be impractical if a large number of random shuffles are used to ensure accuracy. Many researchers have developed approximation algorithms to relieve the computing burden imposed by permutation. One particularly attractive alternative to permutation is to calculate the effective number of independent tests, Meff, which has been shown to be promising in genetic association studies. In this study, we compare recently developed Meff methods and validate them by the permutation test with 10,000 random shuffles using two real GWAS data sets: an Illumina 1M BeadChip and an Affymetrix GeneChip\textregistered{} Human Mapping 500K Array Set. Our results show that the simpleM method produces the best approximation of the permutation threshold, and it does so in the shortest amount of time. We also show that Meff is indeed valid on a genome-wide scale in these data sets based on statistical theory and significance tests. The significance thresholds derived can provide practical guidelines for other studies using similar population samples and genotyping platforms.},

We assessed cognitive and psychomotor development of their children at 1 and 4 years, and social competence, ADHD symptoms and other behavioral problems at 4 and 7 years. No associations were observed between prenatal phthalate exposure and cognitive and psychomotor scores at the age of 1 year and at the age of 4 years, except for an association between MBzP and lower psychomotor scores (\textasciicaron{} = -1.49 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = -2.78, -0.21]). 4DEHP concentrations were associated with increased social competence scores at 4 years and with reduced ADHD symptoms at age 4 and 7 years. Increasing MEP concentrations were associated with a reduced risk of inattention symptoms at 4 years. No associations were observed for MBzP, MiBP or MnBP in relation to behavioral problems. This study, with multiple phthalate exposure measurements and measures of neuropsychological domains at different ages, suggest that prenatal phthalate exposure does not adversely affect children's cognitive, psychomotor or behavioral development.},

  abstract = {Background Prior studies suggest associations between fetal exposure to antimicrobial and paraben compounds with adverse reproductive outcomes, mainly in animal models. We have previously reported elevated levels of these compounds for a cohort of mothers and neonates. Objective We examined the relationship between human exposure to parabens and antimicrobial compounds and birth outcomes including birth weight, body length and head size, and gestational age at birth. Methods Maternal third trimester urinary and umbilical cord blood plasma concentrations of methylparaben (MePB), ethylparaben (EtPB), propylparaben (PrPB), butylparaben (BuPB), benzylparaben (BePB), triclosan (2,4,4{${'}$}-trichloro-2{${'}$}-hydroxydiphenyl ether or TCS) and triclocarban (1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) urea or TCC), were measured in 185 mothers and 34 paired singleton neonates in New York, 2007\textendash 2009. Results In regression models adjusting for confounders, adverse exposure-outcome associations observed included increased odds of PTB (BuPB), decreased gestational age at birth (BuPB and TCC) and birth weight (BuPB), decreased body length (PrPB) and protective effects on PTB (BePB) and LBW (3{${'}$}-Cl-TCC) (p{$<$}0.05). No associations were observed for MePB, EtPB, or TCS. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence of associations between antimicrobials and potential adverse birth outcomes in neonates. Findings are consistent with animal data suggesting endocrine-disrupting potential resulting in developmental and reproductive toxicity.},

The mechanism by which paracetamol may modulate the increased risk of developing ADHD is currently unknown. We have conducted an epigenome-wide association study (n = 384 cord blood samples) and investigated whether prenatal exposure to paracetamol is associated with DNA methylation in children diagnosed with ADHD. Results: Analyses identified significant differences in DNA methylation (n = 6211 CpGs) associated with prenatal exposure to paracetamol for more than 20 days in children diagnosed with ADHD compared to controls. In addition, these samples were differentially methylated compared to samples with ADHD exposed to paracetamol for less than 20 days (n = 2089 CpGs) and not exposed to paracetamol (n = 193 CpGs). Interestingly, several of the top genes ranked according to significance and effect size have been linked to ADHD, neural development, and neurotransmission. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of pathways involved in oxidative stress, neurological processes, and the olfactory sensory system, which have previously been implicated in the etiology of ADHD. Conclusions: These initial findings suggest that in individuals susceptible to ADHD, prenatal long-term exposure to paracetamol is associated with DNA methylation differences compared to controls.},

Transient and mild thyroid hormone insufficiency in pregnancy is also associated with impaired neurodevelopment in the offspring (e.g., 3\textendash 4 IQ score loss in association with maternal free thyroxine in the lowest fifth percentile). While inadequate iodine intake remains the most common underlying cause of mild thyroid hormone insufficiency in vulnerable populations including pregnant women, other factors such as exposure to environmental contaminants have recently attracted increasing attention, in particular in interaction with iodine deficiency. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are natural and synthetic substances with ubiquitous exposure in children and adults including pregnant women. EDCs interfere, temporarily or permanently, with hormonal signaling pathways in the endocrine system by binding to hormone receptors and modifying gene expression. Other mechanisms involve alterations in production, metabolism, and transfer of hormones. Experimental studies have shown that exposures to EDCs affect various brain processes such as neurogenesis, neural differentiation and migration, as well as neural connectivity. Neuroimaging studies confirm brain morphological abnormalities (e.g., cortical thinning) consistent with neurodevelopmental impairments as a result of EDC exposures at standard use levels. In this review, we provide an overview of present findings from toxicological and human studies on the anti-thyroid effect of EDCs with a specific attention to fetal and early childhood exposure. This brief overview highlights the need for additional multidisciplinary studies with a focus on thyroid disruption as an underlying mechanism for developmental neurotoxicity of EDC, which can provide insight into modifiable risk factors of developmental delays in children.},

Large concentrations of similar phenolic compounds have been detected in urine, amniotic fluid, and placental tissue, thereby raising questions about its impact on reproduction. The objective of this paper was to investigate the reproductive toxicity of BP-3 in humans and animals. In humans, studies showed that high levels of BP-3 exposure could be linked to an increase in male birth weight but a decline in female birth weight and male gestational age. In fish, BP-3 exposure resulted in a decline in egg production, hatching, and testosterone, along with a down-regulation of steroidogenic genes. In rats, a decrease in epididymal sperm density and a prolonged estrous cycle for females was observed. These positive associations may be attributed to an altered estrogen and testosterone balance as a result of endocrine disrupting effects of BP-3. However, the current body of literature is limited by non-uniform exposure and outcome measurements in studies both across and within species and future studies will need to be conducted in a standardized fashion to allow for a more significant contribution to the literature that allows for better comparison across studies.},

We included four potential modifiable factors: oxygen tension during embryo culture, fresh embryo transfer vs frozen embryo transfer, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) vs conventional insemination or day 3 embryo transfer vs day 5 embryo transfer. Results: Global methylation levels differed between placentas from natural conceptions compared to placentas conceived by IVF. Placentas from embryos cultured at 20\% oxygen showed significant differences in LINE1 methylation compared to in vivo conceptions, while those from embryos cultured at 5\% oxygen, did not have significant differences. In addition, placentas from fresh embryo transfer had significantly different LINE1 methylation compared to placentas from in vivo conceptions, while embryos resulting from frozen embryos were not significantly different from controls. On sex-stratified analysis, only males had significant methylation differences at LINE1 elements stratified for the modifiable factors. As expected, LINE1 methylation was significantly different between males and females in the control population. However, we did not observe sex-specific differences in the IVF group. We validated this sex-specific observation in an additional cohort and in opposite sex IVF twins. Conclusion: We show that two clinically modifiable factors (embryo culture in 5 vs 20\% oxygen tension and fresh vs frozen embryo transfer) are associated with global placental methylation differences. Interestingly, males appear more vulnerable to such treatment-related global changes in DNA methylation than do females.},

  abstract = {Background Rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes exhibit alterations in cardiac function, ventricular remodeling, and changes in cell signaling, which includes protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Moderate consumption of ethanol has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes in the general population, an effect that has recently been found to extend to patients with diabetes mellitus. We studied the effect of low-dose ethanol consumption on cardiac function, geometry, and PKC isoforms in the rat with STZ-induced diabetes. Methods Four groups of rats were studied over 8 to 10 weeks: control, STZ-induced diabetes, 12\% (v/v) ethanol consumption, and STZ-induced diabetes plus 4\% (v/v) ethanol consumption. Invasive hemodynamic measurements were performed; myocardial tissue was obtained for analysis for total PKC and cytosolic and membrane protein content of PKC-{$\alpha$}, PKC-{$\delta$}, and PKC-{$\epsilon$}, and two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms were obtained. Results Compared with rats with diabetes alone, consumption of 4\% ethanol prevented the decrease in left ventricular dP/dt seen with diabetes alone, as well as the increase in left ventricular internal dimension. Up-regulation of PKC-{$\alpha$}, -{$\delta$}, and -{$\epsilon$} occurring in the diabetic animals was also prevented by ethanol consumption, whereas ethanol alone had no effect on PKC isoform pattern. Conclusions These data suggest that STZ-induced cardiac remodeling and dysfunction are associated with increases in PKC activity, particularly PKC-{$\alpha$}, -{$\delta$}, and -{$\epsilon$}, and that consumption of ethanol can prevent these changes.},

  abstract = {Background The majority of epidemiological studies concerning possible adverse effects of paracetamol (acetaminophen) in pregnancy have been focussed on childhood asthma. Initial results of a robust association have been confirmed in several studies. Recently, a few cohort studies have looked at particular neurocognitive outcomes, and several have implicated hyperactivity. Objectives In order to confirm these findings, further information and results are required. Here, we assess whether paracetamol intake between 18 and 32 weeks gestation is associated with childhood behavioural and cognitive outcomes using a large population. Methods Data collected by the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) at 32 weeks gestation and referring to the period from 18 to 32 weeks, identified 43.9\% of women having taken paracetamol. We used an exposome analysis first to determine the background factors associated with pregnant women taking the drug, and then allowed for those factors to assess associations with child outcomes (measured using regression analyses). Results We identified 15 variables independently associated with taking paracetamol in this time period, which were used as potential confounders. Of the 135 neurocognitive variables considered, adjusting for the likelihood of false discovery, we identified 56 outcomes for adjusted analyses. Adjustment identified 12 showing independent associations with paracetamol use at P {$<$} .05, four of which were at P {$<$} .0001 (all related to child behaviours reported by the mother at 42 and 47 months; eg conduct problems: adjusted mean score + 0.22 (95\% confidence interval 0.10, 0.33)). There were few associations with behavioural or neurocognitive outcomes after age 7-8 years, whether reported by the mother or the teacher. Conclusions If paracetamol use in mid-to-late pregnancy has an adverse effect on child neurocognitive outcome, it appears to mainly relate to the pre-school period. It is important that these results be tested using other datasets or methodologies before assuming that they are causal.},

However, whether there is inflammasome activation in the amniotic cavity of women with PTL and intra-amniotic infection (IAI) or sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (SIAI) is unknown. METHOD OF STUDY: Amniotic fluid samples were collected from women with PTL who delivered at term (n~=~31) or preterm without IAI or SIAI (n~=~35), with SIAI (n~=~27), or with IAI (n~=~17). As a readout of inflammasome activation, extracellular ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) was measured in amniotic fluid by ELISA and the expression of ASC, caspase-1, and interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$} was detected in the chorioamniotic membranes by multiplex immunofluorescence. Acute inflammatory responses in amniotic fluid and the placenta were also evaluated. RESULTS: (a) Amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6 were higher in women with PTL and IAI or SIAI than in those who delivered preterm or at term without intra-amniotic inflammation; (b) amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6 were lower in women with PTL and SIAI than in those with IAI; (c) there was a significant nonlinear correlation between ASC and IL-6 amniotic fluid concentrations; (d) the expression of inflammasome-related proteins (ASC, caspase-1, and IL-1{$\beta$}) in the chorioamniotic membranes was increased in women with PTL and IAI or SIAI than in those who delivered preterm or at term without intra-amniotic inflammation; (e) inflammasome activation in the chorioamniotic membranes was weaker in women with PTL and SIAI than in those with IAI; (f) women with PTL and IAI had elevated amniotic fluid white blood cell counts compared to those without this clinical condition; and (g) severe acute placental inflammatory lesions were observed in women with PTL and IAI and in a subset of women with PTL and SIAI.

However, whether the inflammasome is activated in the amniotic cavity of women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term is unknown. Herein, by measuring extracellular ASC [apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD)], we investigated whether there is in vivo inflammasome activation in amniotic fluid of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and in those with intra-amniotic infection. Methods This was a retrospective cross-sectional study that included amniotic fluid samples collected from 76 women who delivered after spontaneous term labor with diagnosed clinical chorioamnionitis. Intra-amniotic inflammation was defined as an elevated amniotic fluid interleukin (IL)-6 concentration {$\geq$}2.6 ng/mL, and intra-amniotic infection was diagnosed by the presence of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (MIAC) accompanied by intra-amniotic inflammation. Patients were classified into the following groups: (1) women without intra-amniotic inflammation or infection (n=16); (2) women with MIAC but without intra-amniotic inflammation (n=5); (3) women with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation (n=15); and (4) women with intra-amniotic infection (n=40). As a readout of in vivo inflammasome activation, extracellular ASC was measured in amniotic fluid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Acute inflammatory responses in the amniotic fluid and placenta were also evaluated. Results In clinical chorioamnionitis at term: (1) amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC (extracellular ASC is indicative of in vivo inflammasome activation) and IL-6 were greater in women with intra-amniotic infection than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation, regardless of the presence of MIAC; (2) amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6 were also higher in women with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation, regardless of the presence of MIAC; (3) amniotic fluid concentrations of IL-6, but not ASC, were more elevated in women with intra-amniotic infection than in those with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation; (4) a positive and significant correlation was observed between amniotic fluid concentrations of ASC and IL-6; (5) no differences were observed in amniotic fluid ASC and IL-6 concentrations between women with and without MIAC in the absence of intra-amniotic inflammation; (6) women with intra-amniotic infection had elevated white blood cell counts and reduced glucose levels in amniotic fluid compared to the other three study groups; and (7) women with intra-amniotic infection presented higher frequencies of acute maternal and fetal inflammatory responses in the placenta than those with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation. Conclusion The intra-amniotic inflammatory response, either induced by alarmins or microbes, is characterized by the activation of the inflammasome - as evidenced by elevated amniotic fluid concentrations of extracellular ASC - in women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term. These findings provide insight into the intra-amniotic inflammatory response in women with clinical chorioamnionitis at term.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent technology has made it possible to measure DNA methylation profiles in a cost-effective and comprehensive genome-wide manner using array-based technology for epigenome-wide association studies. However, identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) remains a challenging task because of the complexities in DNA methylation data. Supervised methods typically focus on the regions that contain consecutive highly significantly differentially methylated CpGs in the genome, but may lack power for detecting small but consistent changes when few CpGs pass stringent significance threshold after multiple comparison. Unsupervised methods group CpGs based on genomic annotations first and then test them against phenotype, but may lack specificity because the regional boundaries of methylation are often not well defined. We present coMethDMR, a flexible, powerful, and accurate tool for identifying DMRs. Instead of testing all CpGs within a genomic region, coMethDMR carries out an additional step that selects co-methylated sub-regions first. Next, coMethDMR tests association between methylation levels within the sub-region and phenotype via a random coefficient mixed effects model that models both variations between CpG sites within the region and differential methylation simultaneously. coMethDMR offers well-controlled Type I error rate, improved specificity, focused testing of targeted genomic regions, and is available as an open-source R package.},

Inter-day relative standard deviation was {$<$}15\% in all cases. Limit of quantification (LOQ) for these PCBs ranged from 0.08 to 0.13 ng/ml and for these OCPs from 0.16 to 0.40 ng/ml. The optimized method was applied to the analysis of 1000 serum samples from different places of Spain.},

  abstract = {Agricultural and residential use of organophosphate (OP) pesticides has increased in recent decades after banning some persistent pesticides. Although there is evidence of the effects of OPs on neurodevelopment and behaviour in adults, limited information is available about their effects in children, who might be more vulnerable to neurotoxic compounds. This paper was aimed at analysing the scientific evidence published to date on potential neurodevelopmental and behavioural effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to OPs. A systematic review was undertaken to identify original articles published up to December 2012 evaluating prenatal or postnatal exposure to OPs in children and effects on neurodevelopment and/or behaviour. Articles were critically compared, focusing on the methodology used to assess exposure and adverse effects, as well as potential contributing factors that may modify both exposure and outcomes, such as genetic susceptibility to certain enzymes involved in OPs metabolisation (e.g. paraoxonase-1) and gender differences. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria, 7 of which evaluated prenatal exposure to OPs, 8 postnatal exposure and 5 both pre- and postnatal exposure. Most of the studies evaluating prenatal exposure observed a negative effect on mental development and an increase in attention problems in preschool and school children. The evidence on postnatal exposure is less consistent, although 2 studies found an increase in reaction time in schoolchildren. Some paraoxonase-1 polymorphisms could enhance the association between OPs exposure and mental and psychomotor development. A large variability in epidemiological designs and methodologies used for assessing exposure and outcome was observed across the different studies, which made comparisons difficult. Prenatal and to a lesser extent postnatal exposure to OPs may contribute to neurodevelopmental and behavioural deficits in preschool and school children. Standardised methodologies are needed to allow results to be better compared and to perform a quantitative meta-analysis before drawing any final conclusions.},

Evidence is needed from longitudinal studies to understand their joint impact on child development across time. Objective To study associations between exposure to indoor environmental pollutants or outdoor air pollution during pregnancy and offspring cognitive development trajectories through 7 years. Methods We included 718 Mexican mother-child pairs. Prenatal exposure to indoor environmental pollutants (mold, ventilation, pesticides, tobacco smoke, and use of vidiartred clay pots) was self-reported by the mothers and integrated into an index, or objectively measured in the case of outdoor air pollutants (nitrogen oxides, benzene, toluene, and xylene). Child global cognitive development was measured at 12, 18, 60, or 84 months. Using Latent Class Growth Analysis, we identified three developmental trajectories (positive=108, average=362, low=248). We used multinomial logistic models to test associations between environmental pollutant score (EPS) or outdoor air pollutants, and cognitive development trajectories. Results After adjustment for sociodemographic covariates, EPS was associated with the average (OR=1.26 95\%CI=1.01, 1.55) and low (OR=1.41 95\%CI=1.11, 1.79) trajectories compared to positive; where a unit increase in EPS means an additional prenatal exposure to a pollutant. There was no association between outdoor air pollutants and cognitive development trajectories. Conclusion Children of women who reported higher exposure to indoor environmental pollutants during pregnancy were more likely to follow worse developmental trajectories through 7 years. These results support the development and testing of interventions to reduce exposure to environmental pollutants during pregnancy and early childhood as a potential strategy to improve long-term cognitive development.},

Methods: We conducted multiple linear regression in n\,=\,567 infants at birth, n\,=\,288 children at 1~year, and n\,=\,294 children at 3~years from the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST). We stratified by sex and adjusted for race/ethnicity, maternal education, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, prenatal smoking, maternal age, gestational age, and paternal race. We also conducted analysis restricting to infants not born small for gestational age. Results: We found an association between higher methylation of the sequences regulating paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) and anthropometric z scores at 1~year ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.84; 95\% CI\,=\,0.34, 1.33; p\,=\,0.001) and 3~years ({$\beta$}\,=\,1.03; 95\% CI\,=\,0.37, 1.69; p value\,=\,0.003) in males only. Higher methylation of the DMR regulating mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST) was associated with lower anthropometric z scores in females at 1~year ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,1.03; 95\% CI -\,1.60, -\,0.45; p value\,=\,0.001) and 3~years ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,1.11; 95\% CI -\,1.98, -\,0.24; p value\,=\,0.01). These associations persisted when we restricted to infants not born small for gestational age. Conclusion: Our data support a sex-specific association between altered methylation and weight status in early life. These methylation marks can contribute to the compendium of epigenetically regulated regions detectable at birth, influencing obesity in childhood. Larger studies are required to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {Objective: To provide the first explicit evaluation of the dimensionality of the total difficulties score of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a widely used measure of child mental health. We do so by validating the SDQ across its full range against the prevalence of clinical disorder. Method: We use two large (n = 18,415) nationally-representative surveys of children and adolescents aged 5 to 16 years in the general British population. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires were completed separately by parents, teachers, and children aged 11 to 16 years, and children also received a multi-informant clinician-rated clinical diagnosis. Approximately 7,912 children from the baseline survey were also reassessed for clinical diagnosis at 3-year follow-up. Results: Across the full range of the parent, teacher, and youth SDQ, children with higher total difficulty scores have greater psychopathology as judged by the prevalence of clinical disorder. This was true cross-sectionally and also in predicting to disorder status 3 years later. There was no evidence of threshold effects for the SDQ at either high or low scores, but rather the odds of disorder increased at a constant rate across the range (odds ratios between 1.14 and 1.28 per 1-point increase in SDQ score). Conclusions: Our findings support the use of the SDQ as a genuinely dimensional measure of child mental health. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc. Psychiatry, 2009;48(4):400Y403.

Participants (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 247) from the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohorts were followed-up once between the ages of 8 and 14 years, and concurrent exposures were measured in biospecimen collected at that time (blood Pb, urinary BPA, and phthalate metabolites). Prenatal and childhood exposures to Pb were previously approximated using maternal and child samples. BPA and phthalate metabolites were measured in third trimester maternal urine samples. Significant associations (P {$<$} 0.05) were observed between DNA methylation and exposure biomarkers that were gene and biomarker specific. For example, Pb was only associated with LINE-1 hypomethylation during pregnancy (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.04), while early childhood Pb was instead associated with H19 hypermethylation (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.04). Concurrent urinary mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) was associated with HSD11B2 hypermethylation (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.005). Sex-specific associations, particularly among males, were also observed. In addition to single exposure models, principal component analysis was employed to examine exposure mixtures. This method largely corroborated the findings of the single exposure models.

Diethyl phthalate (DEP) has been found to be anti-androgenic and linked with adverse reproductive effects on males, but effects on females are poorly understood. We designed an integrative and translational study to experimentally examine the effects of DEP exposure at a human-equivalent dose on the mammary transcriptome in rats and to subsequently examine the DEP gene signature in breast tissues (both pre-malignant and tumor) from a population study. In Sprague-Dawley rats treated orally with DEP from birth to adulthood, we identified a signature panel of 107 genes predominantly down-regulated by DEP exposure. Univariate analysis of this 107 DEP gene signature in pre-malignant breast tissues revealed that six genes (P4HA1, MPZL3, TMC4, PLEKHA6, CA8, AREG) were inversely associated with monoethyl phthalate (MEP; the urinary metabolite of DEP) concentration (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) among postmenopausal women; all six genes loaded on to one of seven factors identified by factor analysis. Transcription factor enrichment analysis revealed that genes in this factor were enriched for androgen receptor binding sites. These six genes were also significantly down-regulated in pre-malignant adjacent tissues compared to the corresponding tumor tissues in pair-wise analyses (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Results from our translational study indicate that low level exposure to diethyl phthalate results in measurable genomic changes in breast tissue with implications in breast carcinogenesis.},

Thousands of CpG sites whose tissue-specific methylation levels are strongly correlated with chronological age have been previously identified. However, the majority of these studies have focused primarily on cosmopolitan populations living in the developed world; it is not known if agerelated patterns of DNA methylation at these loci are similar across a broad range of human genetic and ecological diversity. We investigated genome-wide methylation patterns using saliva- and whole blood-derived DNA from two traditionally hunting and gathering African populations: the Baka of the western Central African rain forest and the 6{$\frac{1}{4}$}Khomani San of the South African Kalahari Desert. We identified hundreds of CpG sites whose methylation levels are significantly associated with age, thousands that are significant in a meta-analysis, and replicate trends previously reported in populations of non-African descent. We confirmed that an age-associated site in the promoter of the gene ELOVL2 shows a remarkably congruent relationship with aging in humans, despite extensive genetic and environmental variation across populations. We also demonstrate that genotype state at methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) can affect methylation trends at some age-associated CpG sites. Our study explores the relationship between CpG methylation and chronological age in populations of African hunter-gatherers, who rely on different diets across diverse ecologies. While many age-related CpG sites replicate across populations, we show that considering common genetic variation at meQTLs further improves our ability to detect previously identified age associations.},

  abstract = {Background: Arsenic is one of the most commonly encountered environmental toxicants, and research from model systems has suggested that one mode of its toxic activity may be through alterations in DNA methylation. In utero exposure to arsenic can affect fetal, newborn, and infant health, resulting in a range of phenotypic outcomes. Objectives: This study examined variation in placental DNA methylation and its relationship to arsenic exposure in 343 individuals enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study. Methods: Linear regression models using a reference-free correction to account for cellular composition were employed to determine CpG loci affected by arsenic levels. Results: Total arsenic measured in maternal urine during the second trimester was not associated with methylation in the placenta, whereas arsenic levels quantified through maternal toenail collected at birth were associated with methylation at a single CpG locus (p = 4.1 \texttimes{} 10\textendash 8). Placenta arsenic levels were associated with 163 differentially methylated loci (false discovery rate {$<$} 0.05), with 11 probes within the LYRM2 gene reaching genome-wide significance (p {$<$} 10\textendash 8). Measurement of LYRM2 mRNA levels indicated that methylation was weakly to moderately correlated with expression (r = 0.15, p {$<$} 0.06). In addition, we identified pathways suggesting changes in placental cell subpopulation proportions associated with arsenic exposure. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the potential for arsenic, even at levels commonly experienced in a U.S. population, to have effects on the DNA methylation status of specific genes in the placenta and thus supports a potentially novel mechanism for arsenic to affect long-term c\- hildren's health.},

  abstract = {The cellular expression, structure and function of endoglin, and its implication in several vascular disorders remain enigmatic, even 30 years after its discovery. Endoglin (CD105) is a homodimeric glycoprotein (180~kDa) constitutively expressed in the vascular endothelium. It is essential for cardiovascular development and mutations in the ENG gene lead to Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia, a disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations. Endoglin is also expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast throughout pregnancy, but transiently upregulated in the extravillous trophoblast of anchoring villi. Endoglin modulates responses to several TGF-{$\beta$} superfamily ligands and is essential for the negative regulation by TGF-{$\beta$} isoforms 1 and 3 of extravillous trophoblast differentiation. Membrane endoglin binds endothelial NO synthase and regulates its activation and vasomotor tone. There is also a circulating soluble form of endoglin (sEng; 65~kDa); its levels in the serum of women with preeclampsia are increased and correlated with disease severity. The exact sequence of sEng is still unresolved and the proposed mechanism of release from the syncytium by metalloproteases would not yield the expected size protein. The nature of the ligand sequestered by sEng is also an enigma. sEng is said to block the effects of TGF-{$\beta$} on NO-mediated vasorelaxation. However, sEng alone cannot scavenge these ligands for which it has very low affinity. sEng binds with high affinity to BMP9, which stimulates secretion from endothelial cells of the vascoconstrictor endothelin-1, also implicated in endothelial cell stabilization. It remains to be determined if scavenging of circulating BMP9 by sEng is important in preeclampsia and regulation of hypertension.},

We explored this concept in the placenta to define whether DNA methylation is cell-type specific. Cytotrophoblasts and fibroblasts were isolated from normal midtrimester placentas. Using immunocytochemistry, we demonstrated 95\% purity for cytotrophoblasts and 60\textendash 70\% for fibroblasts. We compared DNA methylation profiles from cytotrophoblasts, fibroblasts and whole placental villi using bisulfite modified genomic DNA hybridized to the Illumina Methylation27 array. Euclidean cluster analysis of the DNA methylation profiles showed two main clusters, one containing cytotrophoblasts and placenta, the other fibroblasts. Differential methylation analysis identified 442 autosomal CpG sites that differed between cytotrophoblasts and fibroblasts, 315 between placenta and fibroblasts and 61 between placenta and cytotrophoblasts. Three candidate methylation differences were validated by targeted pyrosequencing assays. Pyrosequencing assays were developed for CpG sites less methylated in cytotrophoblasts than fibroblasts mapping to the promoter region of the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin 5 (CGB5), as well as two CpG sites mapping to each of two tumor suppressor genes. Our data suggest that epigenetic regulation of gene expression is likely to be a key factor in the functional specificity of cytotrophoblasts. These data are proof of principle for cell-type specific epigenetic regulation in placenta and demonstrate that the methylation profile of placenta is mainly driven by cytotrophoblasts.},

  abstract = {Background Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly used in the manufacture of plastics and epoxy resins. In North America, over 90\% of the population has detectable levels of urinary BPA. Human epidemiological studies have reported adverse behavioral outcomes with BPA exposure in children, however, corresponding effects on children's brain structure have not yet been investigated. The current study examined the association between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA exposure and white matter microstructure in children aged 2 to 5\,years, and investigated whether brain structure mediated the association between BPA exposure and child behavior. Methods Participants were 98 mother-child pairs who were recruited between January 2009 and December 2012. Total BPA concentrations in spot urine samples obtained from mothers in the second trimester of pregnancy and from children at 3\textendash 4\,years of age were analyzed. Children participated in a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at age 2\textendash 5\,years (3.7 {$\pm$} 0.8\,years). Associations between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA and children's fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of 10 isolated white matter tracts were investigated, controlling for urinary creatinine, child sex, and age at the time of MRI. Post-hoc analyses examined if alterations in white matter mediated the relationship of BPA and children's scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results Prenatal maternal urinary BPA was significantly associated with child mean diffusivity in the splenium and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Splenium diffusivity mediated the relationship between maternal prenatal BPA levels and children's internalizing behavior (indirect effect: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.213, CI [0.0167, 0.564]). No significant associations were found between childhood BPA and white matter microstructure. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence for the neural correlates of BPA exposure in humans. Our findings suggest that prenatal maternal exposure to BPA may lead to alterations in white matter microstructure in preschool aged children, and that such alterations mediate the relationship between early life exposure to BPA and internalizing problems.},

The use of routinely collected health data represents one approach to better identifying, quantifying, and understanding the long-term risks or benefits of medication use during pregnancy. As such, the objective of this review was to identify and explore opportunities and challenges associated with using routinely collected health data to examine long-term effects of medication use during pregnancy. Drawing on published research several key methodological issues associated with their use in investigating long-term outcomes are reviewed. While significant opportunities exist to make greater use of routinely collected health data, there are a number of key challenges. Identified challenges relate to aspects of study design and analysis, and include obtaining access to data, the ability to match records across datasets and over long periods of time, how medication exposures are ascertained and classified, issues around loss to follow-up how outcomes are ascertained and classified, and the careful interpretation of results in light of study and data limitations. Understanding key challenges associated with using routinely collected health data to investigate long-term effects of medication use during pregnancy is essential in supporting their appropriate use and interpretation, which will contribute to improving the quality of research undertaken and ensure the reliability of results obtained.},

Indigenous Bolivians (Andean Native Americans) residing for generations at high altitudes have higher birth weights relative to more recent migrants of primarily European ancestry. Previous research demonstrated that the placenta is a key contributor to the preservation of Andean birth weight at high altitude. Our current research investigated how gene expression and epigenetics contributes to the conservation of birth weight at high altitude by examining mRNA expression and DNA methylation differences between placentas of Andeans and those of European ancestry residing at high and low altitude.                                   Methods             : Genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation of villous placenta tissue was quantified utilizing microarray technology. Subjects were of Andean and European ancestry and resident at high (3600m) or low (400m) altitudes. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with altitude or ancestry were identified (FDR{$<$}0.1, |fold change|{$>$}1.25). To predict which DEGs could be regulated by methylation we tested for correlation between gene expression and methylation values.                                   Results             : 69 DEGs associated with altitude (n=36) or ancestry (n=34) were identified. Altitude-associated DEGs included members of the AP-1 transcription factor family. Ancestry-associated DEGs were implicated in inflammatory pathways and associated with pro-angiogenic macrophages. More ancestry-associated DEGs correlated significantly (n=17) (FDR{$<$}0.1) with promoter or gene body methylation (p=0.0242) when compared to altitude associated DEGs (n=8).                                   Conclusions:             Compared to altitude-associated DEGs, methylation regulates more ancestry-associated DEGs, potentially allowing for rapid modification in the expression of inflammatory genes to attract pro-angiogenic macrophages as a means of promoting placental capillary growth in Andeans, regardless of altitude.},

These problems require you to perform statistical model selection to find an optimal model, one that is as simple as possible while still providing good predictive performance. Traditional stepwise selection methods, such as forward and backward selection, suffer from high variability and low prediction accuracy, especially when there are many predictor variables or correlated predictor variables (or both). In the last decade, the higher prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of penalized regression methods have made them an attractive alternative to traditional selection methods. This paper first provides a brief review of the LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and elastic net penalized model selection methods. Then it explains how to perform model selection by applying these techniques with the GLMSELECT procedure, which includes extensive customization options and powerful graphs for steering statistical model selection.},

Compared with wild-type Aqp1(+/+) mice, there was significant placental and embryonic overgrowth in Aqp1(-/+) (loss of maternal allele) and Aqp1(-/-) mice, but not in Aqp1(+/-) (loss of paternal allele) mice at Embryonic Day (E) 12.5-E18.5. In addition, the masses of Postnatal Day 0 (P0) embryos (Aqp1(-/-) and Aqp1(-/+)) were highest among the four types. In Aqp1(-/+) and Aqp1(-/-) mice, phenotypic analysis indicated that the number and branching of blood vessels, as well as the labyrinth area, increased significantly in placentae of E12.5-E18.5 mice. Moreover, there were abnormalities in the placental junctional zone and the labyrinthine zone at E15.5. Quantitative analysis showed that Aqp1 expression decreased significantly in the placentae of Aqp1(-/+) and Aqp1(-/-) mice at E15.5, and that the AQP1 protein expression signals were detected weakly in the decidual and spongioblast layers. Our results demonstrate that Aqp1 is maternally expressed in the placenta, and that its deficiency resulted in placental abnormalities in the mouse. Aqp1 may have a specific inhibitory role in mouse placental development. These results provide new insights for the treatment of diseases relating to placental and embryonic development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spectrum of disorders of the brain is large, covering hundreds of disorders that are listed in either the mental or neurological disorder chapters of the established international diagnostic classification systems. These disorders have a high prevalence as well as short- and long-term impairments and disabilities. Therefore they are an emotional, financial and social burden to the patients, their families and their social network. In a 2005 landmark study, we estimated for the first time the annual cost of 12 major groups of disorders of the brain in Europe and gave a conservative estimate of \texteuro 386 billion for the year 2004. This estimate was limited in scope and conservative due to the lack of sufficiently comprehensive epidemiological and/or economic data on several important diagnostic groups. We are now in a position to substantially improve and revise the 2004 estimates. In the present report we cover 19 major groups of disorders, 7 more than previously, of an increased range of age groups and more cost items. We therefore present much improved cost estimates. Our revised estimates also now include the new EU member states, and hence a population of 514 million people. AIMS: To estimate the number of persons with defined disorders of the brain in Europe in 2010, the total cost per person related to each disease in terms of direct and indirect costs, and an estimate of the total cost per disorder and country. METHODS: The best available estimates of the prevalence and cost per person for 19 groups of disorders of the brain (covering well over 100 specific disorders) were identified via a systematic review of the published literature. Together with the twelve disorders included in 2004, the following range of mental and neurologic groups of disorders is covered: addictive disorders, affective disorders, anxiety disorders, brain tumor, childhood and adolescent disorders (developmental disorders), dementia, eating disorders, epilepsy, mental retardation, migraine, multiple sclerosis, neuromuscular disorders, Parkinson's disease, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep disorders, somatoform disorders, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Epidemiologic panels were charged to complete the literature review for each disorder in order to estimate the 12-month prevalence, and health economic panels were charged to estimate best cost-estimates. A cost model was developed to combine the epidemiologic and economic data and estimate the total cost of each disorder in each of 30 European countries (EU27+Iceland, Norway and Switzerland). The cost model was populated with national statistics from Eurostat to adjust all costs to 2010 values, converting all local currencies to Euro, imputing costs for countries where no data were available, and aggregating country estimates to purchasing power parity adjusted estimates for the total cost of disorders of the brain in Europe 2010. RESULTS: The total cost of disorders of the brain was estimated at \texteuro 798 billion in 2010. Direct costs constitute the majority of costs (37\% direct healthcare costs and 23\% direct non-medical costs) whereas the remaining 40\% were indirect costs associated with patients' production losses. On average, the estimated cost per person with a disorder of the brain in Europe ranged between \texteuro 285 for headache and \texteuro 30,000 for neuromuscular disorders. The European per capita cost of disorders of the brain was \texteuro 1550 on average but varied by country. The cost (in billion \texteuro PPP 2010) of the disorders of the brain included in this study was as follows: addiction: \texteuro 65.7; anxiety disorders: \texteuro 74.4; brain tumor: \texteuro 5.2; child/adolescent disorders: \texteuro 21.3; dementia: \texteuro 105.2; eating disorders: \texteuro 0.8; epilepsy: \texteuro 13.8; headache: \texteuro 43.5; mental retardation: \texteuro 43.3; mood disorders: \texteuro 113.4; multiple sclerosis: \texteuro 14.6; neuromuscular disorders: \texteuro 7.7; Parkinson's disease: \texteuro 13.9; personality disorders: \texteuro 27.3; psychotic disorders: \texteuro 93.9; sleep disorders: \texteuro 35.4; somatoform disorder: \texteuro 21.2; stroke: \texteuro 64.1; traumatic brain injury: \texteuro 33.0. It should be noted that the revised estimate of those disorders included in the previous 2004 report constituted \texteuro 477 billion, by and large confirming our previous study results after considering the inflation and population increase since 2004. Further, our results were consistent with administrative data on the health care expenditure in Europe, and comparable to previous studies on the cost of specific disorders in Europe. Our estimates were lower than comparable estimates from the US. DISCUSSION: This study was based on the best currently available data in Europe and our model enabled extrapolation to countries where no data could be found. Still, the scarcity of data is an important source of uncertainty in our estimates and may imply over- or underestimations in some disorders and countries. Even though this review included many disorders, diagnoses, age groups and cost items that were omitted in 2004, there are still remaining disorders that could not be included due to limitations in the available data. We therefore consider our estimate of the total cost of the disorders of the brain in Europe to be conservative. In terms of the health economic burden outlined in this report, disorders of the brain likely constitute the number one economic challenge for European health care, now and in the future. Data presented in this report should be considered by all stakeholder groups, including policy makers, industry and patient advocacy groups, to reconsider the current science, research and public health agenda and define a coordinated plan of action of various levels to address the associated challenges. RECOMMENDATIONS: Political action is required in light of the present high cost of disorders of the brain. Funding of brain research must be increased; care for patients with brain disorders as well as teaching at medical schools and other health related educations must be quantitatively and qualitatively improved, including psychological treatments. The current move of the pharmaceutical industry away from brain related indications must be halted and reversed. Continued research into the cost of the many disorders not included in the present study is warranted. It is essential that not only the EU but also the national governments forcefully support these initiatives.},

To explore heterogeneity, systematic review authors should generate and test a small number of a priori hypotheses related to patients, interventions, outcomes, and methodology. When inconsistency is large and unexplained, rating down quality for inconsistency is appropriate, particularly if some studies suggest substantial benefit, and others no effect or harm (rather than only large vs. small effects).},

Changes in DNA methylation patterns, an epigenetic modification required for various CNS functions are observed with brain aging and can be prevented by anti-aging interventions, but the relationship of altered methylation to gene expression is poorly understood. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Paired analysis of the hippocampal methylome and transcriptome with aging of male and female mice demonstrates that age-related differences in methylation and gene expression are anti-correlated within gene bod-ies and enhancers. Altered promoter methylation with aging was found to be generally un-related to altered gene expression. A more striking relationship was found between methylation levels at young age and differential gene expression with aging. Highly methylated gene bodies and promoters in early life were associated with age-related increases in gene expression even in the absence of significant methylation changes with aging. As well, low levels of methylation in early life were correlated to decreased expression with aging. This relationship was also observed in genes altered in two mouse Alzheimer's models. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} DNA methylation patterns established in youth, in combination with other epigenetic marks, were able to accurately predict changes in transcript trajectories with aging. These findings are consistent with the develop-mental origins of disease hypothesis and indicate that epigenetic variability in early life may explain differences in aging trajectories and age-related disease.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is globally reprogrammed after fertilization, and as a result, the parental genomes have similar DNA-methylation profiles after implantation except at the germline differentially methylated regions (gDMRs). We and others have previously shown~that human blastocysts might contain thousands of transient maternally methylated gDMRs (transient mDMRs), whose maternal methylation is lost in embryonic tissues after implantation. In this study, we performed genome-wide allelic DNA methylation analyses of purified trophoblast cells from human placentas and, surprisingly, found that more than one-quarter of the transient-in-embryo mDMRs maintained their maternally biased DNA methylation. RNA-sequencing-based allelic expression analyses revealed that some of the placenta-specific mDMRs were associated with expression of imprinted genes (e.g., TIGAR, SLC4A7, PROSER2-AS1, and KLHDC10), and three imprinted gene clusters were identified. This approach also identified some X-linked gDMRs. Comparisons of the data with those from other mammals revealed that genomic imprinting in the placenta is highly variable. These findings highlight the incomplete erasure of germline DNA methylation in the human placenta; understanding this erasure is important for understanding normal placental development and the pathogenesis of developmental disorders with imprinting effects.},

METHODS: We measured BPA in urine from mothers during pregnancy and children at 5 years of age (N=292). Child behavior was assessed by mother and teacher report at age 7 years and direct assessment at age 9 years. RESULTS: Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased internalizing problems in boys, including anxiety and depression, at age 7. No associations were seen with prenatal BPA concentrations and behaviors in girls. Childhood urinary BPA concentrations were associated with increased externalizing behaviors, including conduct problems, in girls at age 7 and increased internalizing behaviors and inattention and hyperactivity behaviors in boys and girls at age 7. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the existing literature showing associations of early life BPA exposure with behavior problems, including anxiety, depression, and hyperactivity in children. Additional information about timing of exposure and sex differences in effect is still needed.},

OBJECTIVES: We examined whether prenatal and postnatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, percent body fat, and obesity in 9-year-old children (n = 311) in the CHAMACOS longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: BPA was measured in spot urine samples collected from mothers twice during pregnancy and from children at 5 and 9 years of age. RESULTS: Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were associated with decreased BMI at 9 years of age in girls but not boys. Among girls, being in the highest tertile of prenatal BPA concentrations was associated with decreased BMI z-score ({$\beta$} = -0.47, 95\% CI: -0.87, -0.07) and percent body fat ({$\beta$} = -4.36, 95\% CI: -8.37, -0.34) and decreased odds of overweight/obesity [odds ratio (OR) = 0.37, 95\% CI: 0.16, 0.91] compared with girls in the lowest tertile. These findings were strongest in prepubertal girls. Urinary BPA concentrations at 5 years of age were not associated with any anthropometric parameters at 5 or 9 years, but BPA concentrations at 9 years were positively associated with BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, and overweight/obesity at 9 years in boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with other cross-sectional studies, higher urinary BPA concentrations at 9 years of age were associated with increased adiposity at 9 years. However, increasing BPA concentrations in mothers during pregnancy were associated with decreased BMI, body fat, and overweight/obesity among their daughters at 9 years of age.},

We examined associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS exposure with performance on assessments of cognition in children. Methods: We included mother-child pairs from Project Viva, a longitudinal Boston-area birth cohort enrolled during 1999\textendash 2002. We quantified concentrations of eight PFASs, including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), in plasma collected from women during pregnancy (median 9.7 weeks gestation) and from children at a visit in mid-childhood (median age 7.7 years). In early childhood (median age 3.2 years) we administered standardized assessments of visual motor skills and vocabulary comprehension, and in mid-childhood we assessed visual motor skills, visual memory, and verbal and non-verbal intelligence. Using multivariable regression, we estimated associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS plasma concentrations with children's cognitive assessment scores, adjusted for relevant covariates including breastfeeding, maternal intelligence, parental education, and household income. Samples sizes ranged from 631 to 971, depending on analysis. Results: Prenatal PFAS concentrations were associated with both better and worse cognitive performance; children with top quartile prenatal concentrations of some PFASs had better visual motor abilities in early childhood and non-verbal IQ and visual memory in mid-childhood, while children with upper quartile prenatal PFOA and PFOS had lower mid-childhood visual-motor scores. In cross-sectional analyses of mid-childhood PFAS concentrations and cognitive assessments, visual-motor scores on the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA) (standardized mean = 100, standard deviation = 15) were lower among children with higher PFHxS (fourth quartile (Q4) vs. Q1: -5.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI): -9.1, -0.8). Upper quartiles of childhood PFOA and PFOS were also associated with somewhat lower childhood WRAVMA scores, but childhood PFASs were not associated with verbal or non-verbal IQ or visual memory. Conclusions: We present evidence suggesting associations of prenatal and childhood PFAS exposure with lower childhood visual motor abilities. Other results were inconsistent, with higher prenatal PFASs associated in some cases with better cognitive outcomes.},

  abstract = {Methylation-based non-invasive prenatal testing of fetal aneuploidies is an alternative method that could possibly improve fetal aneuploidy diagnosis, especially for trisomy 13 (T13) and trisomy 18(T18). Our aim was to study the methylation landscape in placenta DNA from trisomy 13, 18 and 21 pregnancies in an attempt to find trisomy\textendash specific methylation differences better suited for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis. We have conducted highresolution methylation specific bead chip microarray analyses assessing more than 450,000 CpGs analyzing placentas from 12 T21 pregnancies, 12 T18 pregnancies and 6 T13 pregnancies. We have compared the methylation landscape of the trisomic placentas to the methylation landscape from normal placental DNA and to maternal blood cell DNA. Comparing trisomic placentas to normal placentas we identified 217 and 219 differentially methylated CpGs for CVS T18 and CVS T13, respectively (delta {$\beta>$}0.2, FDR{$<$}0.05), but only three differentially methylated CpGs for T21. However, the methylation differences was only modest (delta {$\beta<$}0.4), making them less suitable as diagnostic markers. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the gene set connected to theT18 differentially methylated CpGs was highly enriched for GO terms related to''DNA binding'' and ``transcription factor binding'' coupled to the RNA polymerase II transcription. In the gene set connected to the T13 differentially methylated CpGs we found no significant enrichments.},

A volume of only 150microl serum is used and protein precipitation by methanol is the only sample preparation necessary prior to injection into the column switching system. Pseudo-MRM is used as a detection mode for determination of PFCs, resulting in reduced background noise and considerably increased sensitivity for the perfluorinated alkyl sulfonates and the perfluorinated alkyl sulfonamides. The estimated limits of detection for the method were as low as 0.0020-0.050ngPFCs/ml serum. The accuracy determined from spiking experiments, reported as recovery of added amount, was between 85 and 121\% in the range 0.20-50ngPFC/ml serum, except for perfluorodecylsulfonate for which the accuracy was 146\% at 0.20ngPFC/ml serum. The low sample volume needed, the limited manual handling and the broad range of analytes which are included, make this method advantageous for large-scale epidemiological studies. This column-switching technique can easily be set up on standard LC-MS/MS instruments and is thus available to a wide range of laboratories.},

  abstract = {The GNAS1 gene encodes the \textvisiblespace{} subunit of the G protein Gs, which couples receptor binding by several hormones to activation of adenylate cyclase. Null mutations of GNAS1 cause pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) type Ia, in which hormone resistance occurs in association with a characteristic osteodystrophy. The observation that PHP Ia almost always is inherited maternally has led to the suggestion that GNAS1 may be an imprinted gene. Here, we show that, although Gs\textvisiblespace{} expression (directed by the promoter upstream of exon 1) is biallelic, GNAS1 is indeed imprinted in a promoter-specific fashion. We used parthenogenetic lymphocyte DNA to screen by restriction landmark genomic scanning for loci showing differential methylation between paternal and maternal alleles. This screen identified a region that was found to be methylated exclusively on a maternal allele and was located Ϸ35 kb upstream of GNAS1 exon 1. This region contains three novel exons that are spliced into alternative GNAS1 mRNA species, including one exon that encodes the human homologue of the large G protein XL\textvisiblespace s. Transcription of these novel mRNAs is exclusively from the paternal allele in all tissues examined. The differential imprinting of separate protein products of GNAS1 therefore may contribute to the anomalous inheritance of PHP Ia.},

Despite the popularity of multiple imputation of missing data, its acceptance and application still lag in large-scale studies with complicated datasets such as CanCORS. We use sequential regression multiple imputation, implemented in public-available software, to deal with nonresponse in the CanCORS surveys and construct a centralized completed database that can be easily used by investigators from multiple sites. Our work illustrates the feasibility of multiple imputation in a large-scale multiobjective survey, showing its capacity to handle complex missing data. We present the implementation process in detail as an example for practitioners and discuss some of the challenging issues which need further research.},

However, genome-wide analyses are scarce and cross-sectional analyses are hampered by many potential confounding factors. Moreover, causal relations are hard to identify due to the lack of controlled experimental designs. In the current study, we therefore combined a comprehensive assessment of genome-wide DNA methylation differences in people exposed to the great Chinese famine in utero with an in vitro study in which we deprived fibroblasts of nutrition. Methods: We compared whole blood DNA methylation differences between 25 individuals in utero exposed to famine and 54 healthy control individuals using the HumanMethylation450 platform. In vitro, we analyzed DNA methylation changes in 10 fibroblast cultures that were nutritionally deprived for 72 h by withholding fetal bovine serum. Results: We identified three differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in four genes (ENO2, ZNF226, CCDC51, and TMA7) that were related to famine exposure in both analyses. Pathway analysis with data from both Chinese famine samples and fibroblasts highlighted the nervous system and neurogenesis pathways as the most affected by nutritional deprivation. Conclusions: The combination of cross-sectional and experimental data provides indications that biological adaptation to famine leads to DNA methylation changes in genes involved in the central nervous system.},

Over the past 5 years, several human epidemiological studies have reported a positive association between BPA exposure and adverse health outcomes in children, including obesity, asthma, preterm birth, and neuro-behavioural disturbances. These findings are in conflict with international environmental risk assessment models, which predict daily exposure levels to BPA should not pose a risk to child health. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the evidence for different exposure sources and potential exposure pathways of BPA in early childhood. By collating the findings from experimental models and exposure associations observed in human bio-monitoring studies, we affirm the potential for non-dietary sources to make a substantial contribution to total daily exposure in young children. Infants and toddlers have distinctive exposure sources, physiology, and metabolism of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We recommend risk-assessment models implement new frameworks, which specifically address exposure and hazard in early childhood. This is particularly important for BPA, which is present in numerous products in the home and day-care environments, and for which animal studies report contradictory findings on its safety at environmentally relevant levels of exposure.},

Data on 3-year mortality and the predictors of age, dyspnea, and airflow obstruction were available. We simulated missing data by omitting the predictor dyspnea cohort-wide, and we present 6 methods for handling the missing variable. We assessed model performance with regard to discriminative ability and calibration and by using 2 vignette scenarios. We showed that the use of any imputation method outperforms the omission of the cohort from the validation, which is a commonly used approach. Compared with using the full data set without the missing variable (benchmark), multiple imputation with fixed or random intercepts for cohorts was the best approach to impute the systematically missing predictor. Findings of this study may facilitate the use of cohort studies that do not include all predictors and pave the way for more widespread external validation of prediction models even if 1 or more predictors of the model are systematically missing.},

  abstract = {Background Chlordecone is a persistent organochlorine insecticide with well-defined estrogenic properties. It was intensively used in the French West Indies until 1993 to control the banana root borer. Because of the long-term contamination of soils and water, the population is currently exposed to chlordecone through food consumption. Chlordecone has been found in the blood of pregnant women and in cord blood. It has been shown to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical and exposure during pregnancy may affect fetal growth. Objectives The objective of our study was to examine the association between prenatal exposure to chlordecone and fetal growth based on the TIMOUN birth cohort conducted in Guadeloupe, with a focus on the potential modification of this relationship by maternal body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG). Methods Chlordecone was determined in cord plasma at birth in 593 babies. Birth weight was the indicator of fetal growth. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG were determined. Adherence to GWG recommendations of the US Institute of Medicine based on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was assessed. Birth weight was analyzed relative to cord blood chlordecone levels using linear and non-linear regression models. Results Overall chlordecone in cord blood was not associated with birth weight, but we found an interaction between chlordecone exposure with GWG and adherence to GWG recommendations. After stratification by GWG, we found a significant U-shaped association between birth weight and chlordecone exposure, within the upper quartiles of GWG or excessive GWG. Conclusion Chlordecone exposure may affect fetal growth, particularly when excessive GWG is present.},

Here, we investigate the consequences of reduced adipose tissue (AT) Repin1 expression in vivo. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We have inactivated the Repin1 gene in adipose tissue (iARep-/-) at an age of 4 weeks using tamoxifen-inducible gene targeting strategies on the background of C57BL/6NTac mice. Furthermore, we differentiated human primary adipocytes derived from subcutaneous AT in vitro and knocked down REPIN1 using siRNA technique to measure glycerol release. RESULTS: Conditional Repin1 inactivation results in decreased AT mass, smaller adipocytes in both, subcutaneous and epigonadal AT compared to controls. Compared to controls, iARep-/- mice were more insulin sensitive, had better glucose tolerance and lower LDL-, HDL- and total cholesterol. Significantly lower AT expression of the Repin1 target genes Cd36 and Lcn2 may contribute to the phenotype of iARep-/- mice. Knockdown of REPIN1 in human in vitro differentiated adipocytes revealed an increased glycerol release. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, deficiency of Repin1 in AT causes alterations in AT morphology and function, which may underlay lower body weight and improved parameters of insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the di culty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then speci\"yc to a particular treatment e ect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment e ect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the 2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random e ects meta-analysis to the standard error of a \"yxed e ect meta-analytic estimate, and I 2 is a transformation of H that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in \"yve example data sets showing di erent amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I 2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Changes in placental function have been observed with many antenatal conditions that are risk factors for preterm birth and/or poor neurodevelopment including fetal growth restriction and in-utero inflammation. This review will highlight placental factors that have been studied to understand the underlying mechanisms and identify biomarkers that lead to poor child neurodevelopmental outcomes. These include changes in gross morphological and histopathological structure and the placental inflammatory response to prenatal infection. Further, we will describe the placenta's role as both a barrier to maternally-derived bioactive substances critical for normal fetal brain development, such as cortisol, and a source of neuroactive steroids and neurotrophins known to have critical functions in neuronal proliferation, axonal growth, myelination and the regulation of apoptosis. Finally, emerging data supporting the potential utility of novel placental biomarkers in the early prediction of poor neurodevelopmental outcome in infants born both preterm and term will be discussed. These include the assessment of genetic variants (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms in placental tissue) and epigenetic biomarkers (e.g. placental microRNAs and placental DNA methylation). With the placenta the key tissue regulating the fetal environment, integration of observed changes in placental function with genetic and epigenetic variations may advance our ability to predict future infant health. Ultimately, this may facilitate targeted allocation of health resources with the aim of improving lifelong neurodevelopmental capability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) have been widely used in consumer products. Exposures in the United States and in world populations are widespread. PFC exposures have been linked to various health impacts, and data in animals suggest that PFCs may be potential developmental neurotoxicants. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the associations between exposures to four PFCs and parental report of diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2000 and 2003-2004 for children 12-15 years of age. Parental report of a previous diagnosis by a doctor or health care professional of ADHD in the child was the primary outcome measure. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) levels were measured in serum samples from each child. RESULTS: Parents reported that 48 of 571 children included in the analysis had been diagnosed with ADHD. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for parentally reported ADHD in association with a 1-{$\mu$}g/L increase in serum PFOS (modeled as a continuous predictor) was 1.03 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.05]. Adjusted ORs for 1-{$\mu$}g/L increases in PFOA and PFHxS were also statistically significant (PFOA: OR = 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.23; PFHxS: OR = 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.02-1.11), and we observed a nonsignificant positive association with PFNA (OR = 1.32; 95\% CI, 0.86-2.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results, using cross-sectional data, are consistent with increased odds of ADHD in children with higher serum PFC levels. Given the extremely prevalent exposure to PFCs, follow-up of these data with cohort studies is needed.},

Previous studies used epigenetic data sets associated with the germline transmission of epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and novel ML approaches to predict genome-wide locations of critical epimutations. A combination of Active Learning (ACL) and Imbalanced Class Learning (ICL) was used to address past problems with ML to develop a more efficient feature selection process and address the imbalance problem in all genomic data sets. The power of this novel ML approach and our ability to predict epigenetic phenomena and associated disease is suggested. The current approach requires extensive computation of features over the genome. A promising new approach is to introduce Deep Learning (DL) for the generation and simultaneous computation of novel genomic features tuned to the classification task. This approach can be used with any genomic or biological data set applied to medicine. The application of molecular epigenetic data in advanced machine learning analysis to medicine is the focus of this review.},

  abstract = {The type-I interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) response is critical to immunity against viruses and can be triggered in many cell types by cytosolic detection of viral infection, or in differentiated plasmacytoid dendritic cells by the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) subfamily, which generates signals via the adaptor MyD88 to elicit robust IFN induction. Using mice deficient in the Irf7 gene (Irf7-/- mice), we show that the transcription factor IRF-7 is essential for the induction of IFN-alpha/beta genes via the virus-activated, MyD88-independent pathway and the TLR-activated, MyD88-dependent pathway. Viral induction of MyD88-independent IFN-alpha/beta genes is severely impaired in Irf7-/- fibroblasts. Consistently, Irf7-/- mice are more vulnerable than Myd88-/- mice to viral infection, and this correlates with a marked decrease in serum IFN levels, indicating the importance of the IRF-7-dependent induction of systemic IFN responses for innate antiviral immunity. Furthermore, robust induction of IFN production by activation of the TLR9 subfamily in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is entirely dependent on IRF-7, and this MyD88-IRF-7 pathway governs the induction of CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus, all elements of IFN responses, whether the systemic production of IFN in innate immunity or the local action of IFN from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, are under the control of IRF-7.},

The highest doses of triclosan (50 and 100{$\mu$}M) showed a strong cytotoxic effect. Anti proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were also observed.

Objective: To examine associations between dentine biomarkers of manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) and later childhood behaviors. Methods: Subjects enrolled in a longitudinal birth cohort study in Mexico City provided naturally shed deciduous teeth. We estimated weekly prenatal and postnatal dentine Mn, Zn and Pb concentrations in teeth using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and measured behavior at ages 8\textendash 11 years of age using the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition (BASC-2). We used distributed lag models and lagged weighted quantile sum regression to identify the role of individual and combined dentine biomarkers of Mn, Zn and Pb on behavioral outcomes controlling for maternal education and gestational age. Results: Among the 133 subjects included in this study, prenatal and early postnatal dentine Mn appeared protective against childhood behavioral problems, specifically hyperactivity and attention. Postnatal dentine Mn was associated with increased reporting of internalizing problems, specifically anxiety. At 6 months, a 1-unit increase (unit = 1 SD of log concentration) in Mn was associated with a 0.18-unit (unit = 1 SD of BASC-2 score) increase in internalizing symptoms score and a 0.25-unit increase in anxiety. Postnatal Pb was associated with increasing anxiety symptoms; at 12 months, a 1-unit increase in Pb was associated with a 0.4 unit increase in anxiety symptoms. When examined as a metal mixture, we observed two potential windows of susceptibility to increased anxiety symptoms: the first window (0\textendash 8 months) appeared driven by Mn, the second window (8\textendash 12 months) was driven by the metal mixture and dominated by Pb. A 1-unit increase in the mixture index was associated with a 0.7-unit increase in SD of anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: Childhood behaviors may demonstrate postnatal windows of susceptibility to individual and mixed metal concentrations measured in deciduous teeth. Prenatal dentine Mn may be protective, while excessive early postnatal Mn may increase risk for adverse behaviors. In combination, higher concentrations of Mn, Zn and Pb may have an adverse impact on behavior.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Recently there has been increasing interest in the effects of cell mixture on the measurement of DNA methylation, specifically the extent to which small perturbations in cell mixture proportions can register as changes in DNA methylation. A recently published set of statistical methods exploits this association to infer changes in cell mixture proportions, and these methods are presently being applied to adjust for cell mixture effect in the context of epigenome-wide association studies. However, these adjustments require the existence of reference datasets, which may be laborious or expensive to collect. For some tissues such as placenta, saliva, adipose or tumor tissue, the relevant underlying cell types may not be known. RESULTS: We propose a method for conducting epigenome-wide association studies analysis when a reference dataset is unavailable, including a bootstrap method for estimating standard errors. We demonstrate via simulation study and several real data analyses that our proposed method can perform as well as or better than methods that make explicit use of reference datasets. In particular, it may adjust for detailed cell type differences that may be unavailable even in existing reference datasets.

  abstract = {Background: The impact of cell-composition effects in analysis of DNA methylation data is now widely appreciated. With the availability of a reference data set consisting of DNA methylation measurements on isolated cell types, it is possible to impute cell proportions and adjust for them, but there is increasing interest in methods that adjust for cell composition effects when reference sets are incomplete or unavailable. Results: In this article we present a theoretical basis for one such method, showing that the total effect of a phenotype on DNA methylation can be decomposed into orthogonal components, one representing the effect of phenotype on proportions of major cell types, the other representing either subtle effects in composition or global effects at focused loci, and that it is possible to separate these two types of effects in a finite data set. We demonstrate this principle empirically on nine DNA methylation data sets, showing that the first few principal components generally contain a majority of the information on cell-type present in the data, but that later principal components nevertheless contain information about a small number of loci that may represent more focused associations. We also present a new method for determining the number of linear terms to interpret as cell-mixture effects and demonstrate robustness to the choice of this parameter. Conclusions: Taken together, our work demonstrates that reference-free algorithms for cell-mixture adjustment can produce biologically valid results, separating cell-mediated epigenetic effects (i.e. apparent effects arising from differences in cell composition) from those that are not cell mediated, and that in general the interpretation of associations evident from DNA methylation should be carefully considered.},

  abstract = {Selection bias due to loss to follow up represents a threat to the internal validity of estimates derived from cohort studies. Over the last fifteen years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-ofcensoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-to-event framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute measure (e.g. absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, realworld data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-ofcensoring weighted techniques.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In animal studies, perfluorinated alkyl substances affect growth and neuro-behavioural outcomes. Human epidemiological studies are sparse. The aim was to investigate the association between pregnancy serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and offspring behaviour and motor development at 5-9 years of age. METHODS: Maternal sera from the INUENDO cohort (2002-2004) comprising 1,106 mother-child pairs from Greenland, Kharkiv (Ukraine) and Warsaw (Poland) were analysed for PFOS and PFOA, using liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry. Exposures were grouped into country specific as well as pooled tertiles as well as being used as continuous variables for statistical analyses. Child motor development and behaviour at follow-up (2010-2012) were measured by the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire 2007 (DCDQ) and Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively. Exposure-outcome associations were analysed by multiple logistic and linear regression analyses. RESULTS: In the pooled analysis, odds ratio (OR) (95\% confidence interval (CI)) for hyperactivity was 3.1 (1.3, 7.2) comparing children prenatally exposed to the highest PFOA tertile with those exposed to the lowest PFOA tertile. Comparing children in the highest PFOS tertile with those in the lowest PFOS tertile showed elevated but statistically non-significant OR of hyperactivity (OR (95\% CI) 1.7 (0.9, 3.2)). In Greenland, elevated PFOS was associated with higher SDQ-total scores indicating more behavioural problems ({$\beta$} (95\% CI)=1.0 (0.1, 2.0)) and elevated PFOA was associated with higher hyperactivity sub-scale scores indicating more hyperactive behaviour ({$\beta$} (95\% CI)=0.5 (0.1, 0.9)). Prenatal PFOS and PFOA exposures were not associated with motor difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA may have a small to moderate effect on children's neuro-behavioural development, specifically in terms of hyperactive behaviour. The associations were strongest in Greenland where exposure contrast is largest.},

We have examined the association between maternal folate and birth weight and assessed the mediating role of DNA methylation at nine differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of genomically imprinted genes in these associations. Compared with newborns of women with folate levels in the lowest quartile, birth weight was higher in newborns of mothers in the second ({$\beta$} = 143.2, se = 63.2, P = 0.02), third ({$\beta$} = 117.3, se = 64.0, P = 0.07), and fourth ({$\beta$} = 133.9, se = 65.2, P = 0.04) quartiles, consistent with a threshold effect. This pattern of association did not vary by race/ethnicity but was more apparent in newborns of non-obese women. DNA methylation at the PLAGL1, SGCE, DLK1/MEG3 and IGF2/H19 DMRs was associated with maternal folate levels and also birth weight, suggestive of threshold effects. MEG3 DMR methylation mediated the association between maternal folate levels and birth weight (P =0.06). While the small sample size and partial scope of examined DMRs limit our conclusions, our data suggest that, with respect to birth weight, no additional benefits may be derived from increased maternal folate concentrations, especially in non-obese women. These data also support epigenetic plasticity as a key mechanistic response to folate availability during early fetal development.},

Three phthalates, estrogens in cord blood and protein expression of PPARG in placenta were measured. Linear regression were used to analyze the relationship between phthalates exposure, PPARG expression and hormones. Phthalate levels in cord blood were positively associated with PPARG protein expression in placenta (p{$<$}0.05), whereas estrogens in cord blood were negatively associated with phthalate levels and PPARG expression (p{$<$}0.05).

The exploration of extreme value events requires the use of heavy-tailed distributions to build a model which fits the data well. One needs to estimate high conditional quantiles of a random variable for extreme events. Quantile regression ultimately yields results which the alternative mean regression method has no hope to offer, leading to it being labeled as the more powerful method. In order to improve this approach even further, a weighted quantile regression method is introduced with a complete comparison to the unweighted method. The Monte Carlo simulations show good results for the proposed weighted method. Comparisons of the proposed method and existing methods are given. The paper also investigates two real-world examples of applications on extreme events using the proposed weighted method.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epigenetic mechanisms, such as altered DNA methylation, may participate in the relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse birth outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To explore the mediation effect of DNA methylation in the associations of phthalate exposure before delivery with birth outcomes in a Chinese cohort. METHODS: Eight phthalate metabolites in maternal urine before delivery and DNA methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) in cord blood were determined among 106 mother-infant pairs. General additive models were used to assess the associations of maternal urinary phthalate metabolites with birth outcomes and DNA methylation; the mediating role of DNA methylation in cord blood was evaluated by mediation analysis. RESULTS: We found sex-specific associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and birth outcomes and DNA methylation of cord blood. For example, the molar sum of di-2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate ({$\sum$}DEHPm) metabolites in maternal urine was positively associated with gestational age among male newborns only (P {$<$} 0.05); maternal urinary monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was negatively associated with Alu methylation among female newborns only (P {$<$} 0.05). Mediation analysis did not find that methylation of Alu and LINE-1 to be a direct mediator in the relationships between maternal urinary phthalate metabolites before delivery and birth outcomes. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to certain phthalates was associated with altered birth outcomes and decreased repetitive element methylation of newborns. However, the altered birth outcomes exerted by prenatal phthalate exposure does not seem to be directly mediated through repetitive element methylation in cord blood.},

Methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) is a well-established measure of DNA methylation often used in epidemiologic studies. Yet, few studies have examined the effects of host factors on LINE-1 and Alu methylation in children., We characterized the relationship of age, sex, and prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), with DNA methylation in a birth cohort of Mexican-American children participating in the CHAMACOS study., We measured Alu and LINE-1 methylation by pyrosequencing bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from whole blood samples collected from newborns and 9-year old children (n=358). POPs were measured in maternal serum during late pregnancy., Levels of DNA methylation were lower in 9-year olds compared to newborns and were higher in boys compared to girls. Higher prenatal DDT/E exposure was associated with lower Alu methylation at birth, particularly after adjusting for cell type composition (p=0.02 for o,p{${'}$} -DDT). Associations of POPs with LINE-1 methylation were only identified after examining the co-exposure of DDT/E with PBDEs simultaneously., Our data suggest that repeat element methylation can be an informative marker of epigenetic differences by age and sex and that prenatal exposure to POPs may be linked to hypomethylation in fetal blood. Accounting for co-exposure to different types of chemicals and adjusting for blood cell types may increase sensitivity of epigenetic analyses for epidemiological studies.},

Exposure to phthalates during critical periods in utero has been associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes but the biological mechanisms linking these exposures with disease are not well characterized. In this study, we examined the relationship of in utero phthalate exposure with repetitive element DNA methylation, an epigenetic marker of genome instability, in children from the longitudinal birth cohort CHAMACOS. Methylation of Alu and long interspersed nucleotide elements (LINE-1) was determined using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA isolated from whole blood samples collected from newborns and 9 year old children (n=355). Concentrations of eleven phthalate metabolites were measured in urine collected from pregnant mothers at 13 and 26 weeks gestation. We found a consistent inverse association between prenatal concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, the most frequently detected urinary metabolite, with cord blood methylation of Alu repeats ({$\beta$}(95\%CI): -0.14 (-0.28,0.00) and -0.16 (-0.31, -0.02)) for early and late pregnancy, respectively, and a similar but weaker association with LINE-1 methylation. Additionally, increases in urinary concentrations of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites during late pregnancy were associated with lower levels of methylation of Alu repeats in 9 year old blood (significant p-values ranged from 0.003 to 0.03). Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to some phthalates may influence differences in repetitive element methylation, highlighting epigenetics as a plausible biological mechanism through which phthalates may affect health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alkylphenols, such as nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (4-OP), have the potential to disturb immune system due to their weak estrogen-like activity, an effect with potential serious public health impact due to the worldwide distribution of these substances. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) can secrete large amounts of type I IFNs and are critical in immune regulation. However, there has been limited study about the influence of alkylphenols on the function of pDCs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of alkylphenols on pDC functions in vitro and in vivo and then further explored the involved signaling pathways and epigenetic changes. METHODS: Circulating pDCs from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with alkylphenols with or without CpG stimulation. Alkylphenol-associated cytokine responses, signaling events, histone modifications and viral activity were further examined. In NP-exposed mice, the effect of NP on splenic pDC function and allergic lung inflammation were also assessed. RESULTS: The results showed that NP increased the expression of TNF-{$\alpha$}, but suppressed IL-10 production in the range of physiological doses, concomitant with activation of the MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathway and enhanced levels of acetylated histone 3 as well as histone 4 at the TNFA gene locus. Further, in CpG-stimulated pDCs, NP suppressed type I IFNs production, associated with down-regulation of IRF-7 and MKK1/2-ERK-Elk-1 pathways and led to the impaired anti-enterovirus 71 activity in vitro. Additionally, splenic pDCs from NP-exposed mice showed similar cytokine changes upon CpG stimulation under conditions relevant to route and level of exposure in humans. NP treatment also enhanced allergic lung inflammation in vivo. CONCLUSION: Alkylphenols may influence pDCs' functions via their abilities to induce expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-{$\alpha$}, and to suppress regulatory cytokines, including IL-10, IFN-{$\alpha$} and IFN-{$\beta$}, suggesting the potential impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals on immune regulation.},

  abstract = {Cellular processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied, but its precise function remains elusive. The intracellular domain of APP has been proposed to regulate expression of several genes by mechanisms that are largely unknown. We report that APP regulates expression of the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in transgenic mice. AQP1 mRNA and protein were down-regulated in fibroblasts lacking APP or presenilin 2 in which AQP1 expression was restored by stable expression of full-length APP or presenilin 2 but not by APP deleted from its carboxy-terminal domain. The transcriptional activity of the AQP1 gene promoter and the stability of AQP1 mRNA were identical in fibroblasts expressing or not expressing APP. Control of AQP1 expression by APP was sensitive to trichostatin A, an histone deacetylase inhibitor, and histone deacetylase activity coimmunoprecipitated with APP. Altogether, these data show that a presenilin-2-dependent gamma-secretase activity releases the intracellular domain of APP involved in the epigenetic control of AQP1 expression. Since AQP1 is found in astrocytes surrounding senile plaques, this epigenetic control of AQP1 expression could have important implications in Alzheimer disease.},

The committee was asked to address the following tasks: 1. Review evidence on the relationship between weight gain patterns before, during, and after pregnancy and maternal and child health outcomes, with particular attention to the prevalence of maternal obesity racial/ethnic and age differences, components of GWG, and implications of weight during pregnancy on postpartum weight retention, maternal and child obesity, and later child health. 2. Within a life-stage framework consider factors in relation to GWG that are associated with maternal health outcomes such as lactation performance, postpartum weight retention, cardiovascular disease, metabolic processes including glucose and insulin-related issues, and risk of other chronic diseases; for infants and children, in addition to low birth weight, consider early developmental impacts and obesity-related consequences (e.g., mental health, diabetes). 3. Recommend revisions to the existing guidelines, where necessary, including the need for specific pregnancy weight guidelines for underweight, normal weight, and overweight and obese women and adolescents and women carrying twins or higher-order multiples. 4. Consider a range of approaches to promote appropriate weight gain, including: individual (behavior), psychosocial, community, health care, and health systems; timing and components of interventions; and ways to enhance awareness and adoption of the guidelines, including interdisciplinary approaches, consumer education to men and women, strategies to assist practitioners to use the guidelines, and public health strategies. 5.

We examined the effects of bisphenol A, and its derivatives, 3-hydroxybisphenol A and bisphenol A 3,4-quinone on rat behavior as possible metabolites of bisphenol A. A single intracisternal administration of bisphenol A (20 {$\mu$}g equivalent to 87 nmol) into 5-day-old male Wistar rats caused significant hyperactivity at 4-5 weeks of age. It was about 1.3 fold more active in the nocturnal phase than control rats. However, neither 3-hydroxybisphenol A nor bisphenol A 3,4-quinone at the same amount (87 nmol) increased the spontaneous motor activity. Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analyses of the treated brain revealed that 7\% of the parent chemical resided in the brain at 8 weeks of age, but its derivatives were not found. This suggested a difference in metabolic turnover of these compounds or a difference in their stabilities. We conclude that bisphenol A per se caused hyperactivity in the rat, eliminating the possibility that possible metabolic forms of bisphenol A, 3-hydroxybisphenol A and bisphenol A 3,4-quinone have the ability to elicit rat hyperactivity, probably because of longer-lasting residence of the parent compound in the brain.},

  abstract = {Background: Epigenetic modification has an effect on gene expression under the environmental alteration, but it does not change corresponding genome sequence. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one of the important epigenetic mechanisms. DNAm variations could be used as epigenetic markers to predict and account for the change of many human phenotypic traits, such as cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure. In this study, we built deep neural network (DNN) regression models to account for interindividual variation in triglyceride concentrations measured at different visits of peripheral blood samples using epigenome-wide DNAm profiles. Results: We used epigenome-wide DNAm profiles of before and after medication interventions (called pretreatment and posttreatment, respectively) to predict triglyceride concentrations for peripheral blood draws at visit 2 (using pretreatment data) and at visit 4 (using both pretreatment and posttreatment data). Our experimental results showed that DNN models can predict triglyceride concentrations for blood draws at visit 4 using pretreatment and posttreatment DNAm data more accurately than for blood draws at visit 2 using pretreatment DNAm data. Furthermore, we got the best prediction results when we used pretreatment DNAm data to predict triglyceride concentrations for blood draws at visit 4, which suggests a long-term epigenetic effect on phenotypic traits. We compared the prediction performances of our proposed DNN models with that of support vector machine (SVM). This comparison showed that our DNN models achieved better prediction performance than did SVM. Conclusions: We demonstrated the superiority of our proposed DNN models over the SVM model for predicting triglyceride concentrations. This study also suggests that the DNN approach has advantages over other traditional machine-learning methods to model high-dimensional epigenome-wide DNAm data and other genomic data.},

  abstract = {Background During the past 5 years, high-throughput technologies have been successfully used by epidemiology studies, but almost all have focused on sequence variation through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Today, the study of other genomic events is becoming more common in large-scale epidemiological studies. Many of these, unlike the single-nucleotide polymorphism studied in GWAS, are continuous measures. In this context, the exercise of searching for regions of interest for disease is akin to the problems described in the statistical `bump hunting' literature. Methods New statistical challenges arise when the measurements are continuous rather than categorical, when they are measured with uncertainty, and when both biological signal, and measurement errors are characterized by spatial correlation along the genome. Perhaps the most challenging complication is that continuous genomic data from large studies are measured throughout long periods, making them susceptible to `batch effects'. An example that combines all three characteristics is genome-wide DNA methylation measurements. Here, we present a data analysis pipeline that effectively models measurement error, removes batch effects, detects regions of interest and attaches statistical uncertainty to identified regions. Results We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by detecting genomic regions of DNA methylation associated with a continuous trait in a well-characterized population of newborns. Additionally, we show that addressing unexplained heterogeneity like batch effects reduces the number of false-positive regions. Conclusions Our framework offers a comprehensive yet flexible approach for identifying genomic regions of biological interest in large epidemiological studies using quantitative high-throughput methods.},

A series of papers reporting age-related changes in DNA methylation profiles in peripheral blood have already been published. However, blood is a heterogeneous collection of different cell types, each with a very different DNA methylation profile. Results: Using a statistical method that permits estimating the relative proportion of cell types from DNA methylation profiles, we examine data from five previously published studies, and find strong evidence of cell composition change across age in blood. We also demonstrate that, in these studies, cellular composition explains much of the observed variability in DNA methylation. Furthermore, we find high levels of confounding between age-related variability and cellular composition at the CpG level. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the importance of considering cell composition variability in epigenetic studies based on whole blood and other heterogeneous tissue sources. We also provide software for estimating and exploring this composition confounding for the Illumina 450k microarray.},

The potential bias due to missing data depends on the mechanism causing the data to be missing, and the analytical methods applied to amend the missingness. Therefore, the analysis of trial data with missing values requires careful planning and attention. Methods: The authors had several meetings and discussions considering optimal ways of handling missing data to minimise the bias potential. We also searched PubMed (key words: missing data; randomi*; statistical analysis) and reference lists of known studies for papers (theoretical papers; empirical studies; simulation studies; etc.) on how to deal with missing data when analysing randomised clinical trials. Results: Handling missing data is an important, yet difficult and complex task when analysing results of randomised clinical trials. We consider how to optimise the handling of missing data during the planning stage of a randomised clinical trial and recommend analytical approaches which may prevent bias caused by unavoidable missing data. We consider the strengths and limitations of using of best-worst and worst-best sensitivity analyses, multiple imputation, and full information maximum likelihood. We also present practical flowcharts on how to deal with missing data and an overview of the steps that always need to be considered during the analysis stage of a trial.

The objective of the present systematic review was to investigate the association between prenatal exposure to parabens and anthropometric birth outcomes. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases were systematically searched until April 18, 2018. Of 326 records that remained after removing duplicates, 6 original articles were included in the final analysis after excluding irrelevant articles. The included studies indicated that most of the pregnant mothers were exposed to parabens, especially methyl and propyl parabens. However, no definitive association was found between the prenatal urinary concentration of parabens and birth weight or head circumference. In addition, a positive but non-significant association was detected between birth length and maternal exposure to parabens. The present systematic review revealed that assessment of significant associations in current epidemiological studies is impermissible due to methodological limitations and absence of inter-study consistency. Furthermore, because of the complexity of the effect of environmental factors on health, future large-scale studies with proper study design are required to investigate the effect of parabens exposure on birth outcomes.},

This compound has been identified in plasma and urine of people in the United States, Sweden and Australia. Triclosan is known to inhibit sulfonation of phenolic xenobiotics and is structurally related to inhibitors of estrogen sulfotransferase, such as polychlorobiphenylols. In pregnancy, the placenta is an important source of estrogen, which is needed for normal fetal development and successful parturition, and estrogen sulfotransferase is thought to play an important role in regulation of estrogen availability. In this study, we examined the effect of Triclosan on sheep placental cytosolic sulfotransferase activity with 17-beta-estradiol and estrone as substrates. For comparison, we studied the effects of 4-hydroxy-3,3',4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl and 2'-hydroxytriclocarban on estradiol sulfonation. The apparent Km for placental cytosolic sulfotransferase activity with estradiol as substrate was 0.27{$\pm$}0.06~nM (mean{$\pm$}S.D., n=3 individuals) and with estrone as substrate was 1.86{$\pm$}0.22~nM. Partial substrate inhibition was observed with estradiol at concentrations higher than 10\textendash 20~nM, as is typical of estrogen sulfotransferases (SULT1E1) in other species. Studies of the effect of Triclosan on estrogen sulfotransferase activity were conducted with several concentrations (0.1\textendash 6~nM) of estradiol and with 2~nM estrone. Triclosan was a very potent inhibitor of both estradiol and estrone sulfonation. For estradiol the inhibition was shown to be mixed competitive/uncompetitive, with Kic of 0.09{$\pm$}0.01~nM and Kiu of 5.2{$\pm$}2.9~nM. The IC50 for inhibition of estrone sulfonation was 0.60{$\pm$}0.06~nM. At an environmentally relevant concentration of 1~\textmu M, Triclosan was not a substrate for glucuronidation in sheep placental microsomes. Triclosan could be sulfonated in placental cytosol with Km 1.14{$\pm$}0.18~\textmu M and Vmax 160{$\pm$}26~pmol/min/mg protein, however the calculated rates of Triclosan sulfonation were negligible at the low nM concentrations that potently inhibit estrogen sulfonation. The high potency of Triclosan as an inhibitor of estrogen sulfotransferase activity raises concern about its possible effects on the ability of the placenta to supply estrogen to the fetus, and in turn on fetal growth and development.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Epigenetic mechanisms, often defined as regulating gene activity independently of underlying DNA sequence, are crucial for healthy development. The sum total of epigenetic marks within a cell or tissue (the epigenome) is sensitive to environmental influence, and disruption of the epigenome in utero has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Not surprisingly, given its multifaceted functions and important role in regulating pregnancy outcome, the placenta shows unique epigenetic features. Interestingly however, many of these are only otherwise seen in human malignancy (the pseudomalignant placental epigenome). Epigenetic variation in the placenta is now emerging as a candidate mediator of environmental influence on placental functioning and a key regulator of pregnancy outcome. However, replication of findings is generally lacking, most likely due to small sample sizes and a lack of standardization of analytical approaches. Defining DNA methylation "signatures" in the placenta associated with maternal and fetal outcomes offers tremendous potential to improve pregnancy outcomes, but care must be taken in interpretation of findings. Future placental epigenetic research would do well to address the issues present in epigenetic epidemiology more generally, including careful consideration of sample size, potentially confounding factors, issues of tissue heterogeneity, reverse causation, and the role of genetics in modulating epigenetic profile. The importance of animal or in vitro models in establishing a functional role of epigenetic variation identified in human beings, which is key to establishing causation, should not be underestimated.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In our studies, we employed cyclin D2 gene knockout (cD2 KO) mice showing impaired neurogenesis as well as decreased hippocampal size. However, irrespectively of the genetic background of cD2 KO mice, this phenotype resulted in neither deficits in the hippocampal-dependent learning ability nor the memory formation. In the present study, cD2 KO mice and control littermates were subjected to hippocampal-dependent behavioral tests with little or no learning component. The knockout mice showed significant impairment in such species-typical behaviors as nest construction, digging, and marble burying. They were building none or poorer nests, digging less robustly, and burying fewer marbles than control mice. Such impairments were previously described, e.g., in animals with hippocampal lesions. Moreover, cD2 KO animals were also more active in the open field and automated motility chamber as well as showed increased explorative behavior in IntelliCage. Both increased motility and explorative behaviors were previously observed in hippocampally lesioned animals. Finally, cD2 KO mice showed normal sucrose preference, however starting from the second exposure to the sweetened solution, while control animals displayed a strong preference immediately. Presented results suggest that either morphological abnormalities of the hippocampal formation or adult brain neurogenesis impairment (or both) alter hippocampal-dependent behaviors of mutant mice without influencing learning abilities. These results may also suggest that adult brain neurogenesis is involved in species-typical behaviors.},

One states that the illness results from decreased neurogenesis while the other claims that the very functioning of antidepressants depends on increased neurogenesis. In order to verify the latter, we have used cyclin D2 knockout mice (cD2 KO mice), known to have virtually no adult brain neurogenesis, and we demonstrate that these mice successfully respond to chronic fluoxetine. After unpredictable chronic mild stress, mutant mice showed depression-like behavior in forced swim test, which was eliminated with chronic fluoxetine treatment, despite its lack of impact on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in cD2 KO mice. Our results suggest that new neurons are not indispensable for the action of antidepressants such as fluoxetine. Using forced swim test and tail suspension test, we also did not observe depression-like behavior in control cD2 KO mice, which argues against the link between decreased adult brain neurogenesis and major depression. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we measured parabens and their metabolites in organs and tissues (blubber, muscle, melon, stomach, kidney, liver, gonad, brain, uterus, and umbilical cord, total n = 94) of common dolphins ( Delphinus capensis) and finless porpoises ( Neophocaena asiaeorientalis), to investigate tissue-specific accumulation and body burden. Among the target compounds, methyl paraben (MeP) and para-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HB) were detected in all organs. Compared to common dolphins, finless porpoises had significantly higher concentrations of MeP and 4-HB due to their near-shore habitat. Higher concentrations of MeP and 4-HB were found in the kidney, liver, and stomach than in other organs, indicating selective accumulation of parabens in certain organs. Significant correlations between MeP and 4-HB in liver/kidney suggested metabolic transformation of the former to the latter. Detection of parabens in brains, umbilical cords, and uteri suggests that these chemicals cross biological barriers such as the blood-brain and placental barriers. The body burdens of total parabens were in the ranges of 13000-90600 {$\mu$}g and 19800-81500 {$\mu$}g for common dolphins and finless porpoises, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background Benzophenones (BPs), parabens, and triclosan (TCS) are widely used in personal care products and may be neurotoxic to children, but limited studies have estimated the associations between exposure to these potential endocrine disrupting chemicals during pregnancy and child neurocognitive development. Objective Our aim was to evaluate the relationships of prenatal exposure to BPs, parabens and TCS with child neurocognitive development at age 2. Methods From 2014 to 2015, 478 mother-child pairs from a longitudinal prenatal cohort in China were included in present study. We quantified BPs, parabens and TCS in three spot urine samples during pregnancy (in the first, second, and third trimester). The Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) test to children was performed at 2 years. Multivariate linear regression models and generalized estimating equations were used to examine changes in mental developmental index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) per 2-fold increase in averaged and trimester-specific maternal urinary phenols, respectively. Results In the adjusted models, each 2-fold increase in average prenatal paraben concentration was associated with lower MDI scores among girls [-1.08 (95\% CI: -2.10, -0.06) and - 1.51 (95\% CI: -2.69, -0.32) for methyl paraben (Mep) and {$\Sigma$}parabens, respectively], but the association was not statistically significant among boys [-0.24 (95\% CI: -1.46, 0.99), Psex-int = 0.37 and 0.18 (95\% CI: -1.28, 1.64), Psex-int = 0.10 for Mep and {$\Sigma$}parabens, respectively]. Increasing urinary 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP) concentration was associated with lower PDI scores among boys [-2.96 (95\% CI: -4.48, -1.45)], not girls [-0.07 (95\% CI: -1.57, 1.43)] and the association was significantly different in boys and girls (Psex-int = 0.01). No significant associations were observed between the average prenatal TCS exposure and BSID results. In trimester-specific analyses, increasing parabens was associated with lower girls' MDI only in the second trimester, while increasing 4-OH-BP was associated with lower boys' PDI in each trimester. Conclusion Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to BPs and parabens may be associated with impairment in child cognitive abilities at 2 years. Further human and animal studies are needed to verify our results and elucidate the biological mechanisms involved in these associations.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal gene expression during cardiac development is a highly regulated process. Activation of key signaling pathways involved in electrophysiological programming, such as Notch and Wnt signaling, occurs in early cardiovascular development and these pathways are reactivated during pathologic remodeling. Direct targets of these signaling pathways have also been associated with inherited arrhythmias such as Brugada syndrome and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. In addition, evidence is emerging from animal models that reactivation of Notch and Wnt signaling during cardiac pathology may predispose to acquired arrhythmias, underscoring the importance of elucidating the transcriptional and epigenetic effects on cardiac gene regulation. Here, we highlight specific examples where gene expression dictates electrophysiological properties in both normal and diseased hearts.

  abstract = {While Illumina microarrays can be used successfully for detecting small gene expression changes due to their high degree of technical replicability, there is little information on how different normalization and differential expression analysis strategies affect outcomes. To evaluate this, we assessed concordance across gene lists generated by applying different combinations of normalization strategy and analytical approach to two Illumina datasets with modest expression changes. In addition to using traditional statistical approaches, we also tested an approach based on combinatorial optimization. We found that the choice of both normalization strategy and analytical approach considerably affected outcomes, in some cases leading to substantial differences in gene lists and subsequent pathway analysis results. Our findings suggest that important biological phenomena may be overlooked when there is a routine practice of using only one approach to investigate all microarray datasets. Analytical artefacts of this kind are likely to be especially relevant for datasets involving small fold changes, where inherent technical variation\textemdash if not adequately minimized by effective normalization\textemdash may overshadow true biological variation. This report provides some basic guidelines for optimizing outcomes when working with Illumina datasets involving small expression changes.},

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon by which individual alleles of certain genes are expressed diVerentially according to their parent of origin. The alleles appear to be diVerentially marked during gametogenesis or during the early part of development. This mark is heritable but reversible from generation to generation, implying a stable epigenetic modification. Approximately 25 imprinted genes have been identified to date, and dysregulation of a number of these has been implicated in tumour development. The normal physiological role of many imprinted genes is in the control of cell proliferation and fetal growth, indicating potential mechanisms of action in tumour formation. Both dominant and recessive modes of action have been postulated for the role of imprinted genes in neoplasia, as a result of eVective gene dosage alterations by epigenetic modification of the normal pattern of allele specific transcription. The aim of this review is to assess the importance of imprinted genes in generating tumours and to discuss the implications for novel mechanisms of transforming mutation.},

Exposome-wide association study (ExWAS) provides a new approach for conceptualizing the roles and relationships of multiple chemical and nonchemical exposures in the etiology and progression of cancer at key developmental periods, over the life course, and across generations. ExWAS challenges us to consider the influence of both internal and external environment, chemical and non-chemical stressors, risk and protective factors, and spatial and temporal dimensions of exposures in our models of cancer incidence, outcomes, and disparities. Applying an ExWAS approach to cancer and cancer disparities research supports robust computational models and methods that will allow for analysis of the dynamic and complex interactions between genetics, epigenetics, and exposomics factors. In the coming months, we will spatially and temporally align environmental exposures with SCCS participant data from time of enrollment forward to move us closer to identifying complete exposure pathways that lead to cancer. In the future, we hope to link external sources of exposure to biomarkers of exposure, biomarkers of disease, disease phenotypes, and population level disparities.},

In-utero exposure to DDT and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) has been associated with developmental and cognitive impairment among children. We examined this association in an historical cohort in which the level of exposure was greater than in previous studies. METHODS: The association of in-utero DDT and DDE exposure with infant and child neurodevelopment was examined in 1100 subjects in the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a prospective birth cohort enrolling pregnant women from 12 study centers in the United States from 1959 to 1965. Maternal DDT and DDE concentrations were measured in archived serum specimens. Infant mental and motor development was assessed at age 8 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and child cognitive development was assessed at age 7 years, using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. RESULTS: Although levels of DDT and DDE were relatively high in this population (median DDT concentration, 8.9 {$\mu$}g/L; DDE, 24.5 {$\mu$}g/L), neither were related to Mental or Psychomotor Development scores on the Bayley Scales nor to Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient at 7 years of age. Categorical analyses showed no evidence of dose- response for either maternal DDT or DDE, and estimates of the association between continuous measures of exposure and neurodevelopment were indistinguishable from 0. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse associations were not observed between maternal serum DDT and DDE concentrations and offspring neurodevelopment at 8 months or 7 years in this cohort.},

OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine whether maternal urinary concentrations of OP pesticide metabolites are inversely associated with child nonverbal IQ at 6 y of age and to examine potential effect measure modification by the PON1 gene. METHODS: Data came from 708 mother\textendash child pairs participating in the Generation R Study. Maternal urine concentrations of six dialkylphosphates (DAPs), collected at {$<$}18, 18\textendash 25, and {$>$}25 weeks of gestation, were determined. Child nonverbal IQ was measured at 6 y of age using the Mosaics and Categories subtests from the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test\textendash Revised. PON1 was determined in cord blood for 474 infants. Multiple linear regression models were fit to estimate the DAP\textendash IQ associations and PON1 interactions. RESULTS: Overall, associations between child nonverbal IQ and maternal DAP concentrations were small and imprecise, and these associations were inconsistent across urine sampling periods. However, for a 10-fold difference in total DAP concentration for the {$>$}25 weeks of gestation samples, adjusted child nonverbal IQ was 3.9 points lower (95\% CI: -7:5, -0:3). Heterogeneity in the DAP\textendash IQ association by PON1 gene allele status was not observed (n = 474). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent evidence of an association between higher maternal urinary DAP concentrations and lower child IQ scores at 6 y of age was not observed. There was some evidence for an inverse relation of child nonverbal IQ and late pregnancy urinary DAPs, but the estimated association was imprecise. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3024},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human chromosome 14q32.2 imprinted region harbors the primary MEG3/DLK1:IG-differentially methylated region (DMR) and secondary MEG3:TSS-DMR. The MEG3:TSS-DMR can remain unmethylated only in the presence of unmethylated MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR in somatic tissues, but not in the placenta, because of a hierarchical regulation of the methylation pattern between the two DMRs. METHODS: We performed molecular studies in a 4-year-old Japanese girl with Temple syndrome (TS14). RESULTS: Pyrosequencing analysis showed extremely low methylation levels of five CpGs at the MEG3:TSS-DMR and grossly normal methylation levels of four CpGs at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR in leukocytes. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip confirmed marked hypomethylation of the MEG3:TSS-DMR and revealed multilocus imprinting disturbance (MLID) including mild hypomethylation of the H19/IGF2:IG-DMR and mild hypermethylation of the GNAS A/B:TSS-DMR in leukocytes. Bisulfite sequencing showed markedly hypomethylated CpGs at the MEG3:TSS-DMR and irregularly and non-differentially methylated CpGs at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR in leukocytes and apparently normal methylation patterns of the two DMRs in the placenta. Maternal uniparental disomy 14 and a deletion involving this imprinted region were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Such a methylation pattern of the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR has not been reported in patients with TS14. It may be possible that a certain degree of irregular hypomethylation at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR has prevented methylation of the MEG3:TSS-DMR in somatic tissues and that a hypermethylation type MLID has occurred at the MEG3/DLK1:IG-DMR to yield the apparently normal methylation pattern in the placenta.},

In this Series paper, we have reviewed subsequent additions to the literature and identified new exposure\textendash outcome associations with substantial human evidence. Evidence is particularly strong for relations between perfluoroalkyl substances and child and adult obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes, reduced birthweight, reduced semen quality, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, and breast cancer. Evidence also exists for relations between bisphenols and adult diabetes, reduced semen quality, and polycystic ovarian syndrome; phthalates and prematurity, reduced anogenital distance in boys, childhood obesity, and impaired glucose tolerance; organophosphate pesticides and reduced semen quality; and occupational exposure to pesticides and prostate cancer. Greater evidence has accumulated than was previously identified for cognitive deficits and attention-deficit disorder in children following prenatal exposure to bisphenol A, organophosphate pesticides, and polybrominated flame retardants. Although systematic evaluation is needed of the probability and strength of these exposure\textendash outcome relations, the growing evidence supports urgent action to reduce exposure to EDCs.},

Differential expression was initially identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by real time PCR in 42 B-CLL patients. mRNA expression ranged from 0.3- to 375.4-fold compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC). Expression levels in CD19+ B-CLL cells were 100-fold higher than in B-cells from healthy donors. PEG10 expression levels in B-CLL patient samples remained stable over time even after chemotherapy. High PEG10 expression correlated with high LPL expression (p=0.001) and a positive Coombs' test (p=0.04). Interestingly, similar expression patterns were observed for the neighbouring imprinted gene sarcoglycan-epsilon (SGCE). Monoallelic expression and maintained imprinting of PEG10 were found by allele- or methylation-specific PCR. The intensity of intracellular staining of PEG10 protein corresponded to mRNA levels as confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Short term knock-down of PEG10 in B-CLL cells and HepG2 cells was not associated with changes in cell survival but resulted in a significant change in the expression of 80 genes. However, long term inhibition of PEG10 led to induction of apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Our data indicate (i) a prognostic value of PEG10 in B-CLL patients; (ii) specific deregulation of the imprinted locus at 7q21 in high-risk B-CLL; (iii) a potential functional and biological role of PEG10 protein expression. Altogether, PEG10 represents a novel marker in B-CLL.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Exposure to mixtures of environmental chemicals are prevalent among pregnant women and may be associated with altered fetal growth and gestational age. To date, most research regarding environmental chemicals and neonatal outcomes has focused on the effect of individual agents. Methods: In a prospective cohort of 380 pregnant women from Cincinnati, OH (enrolled 2003\textendash 2006), we used biomarkers to estimate exposure to 43 phenols, phthalates, metals, organophosphate/pyrethroid/organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and environmental tobacco smoke. Using three approaches, we estimated covariate-adjusted associations of chemical mixtures or individual chemicals with gestational-age-specific birth weight z-scores, birth length, head circumference, and gestational age: k-means clustering, principal components (PC), and one-chemical-at-a-time regression. Results: We identified three chemical mixture profiles using k-means clustering. Women in cluster 1 had higher concentrations of most phenols, three phthalate metabolites, several metals, organophosphate/organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and several PFAS than women in clusters 2 and 3. On average, infants born to women in clusters 1 (-1.2 cm; 95\% CI: -1.9, -0.5) and 2 (-0.5 cm; 95\% CI: -1.1, 0.1) had lower birth length than infants in cluster 3. Six PCs explained 50\% of the variance in biomarker concentrations and biomarkers with similar chemical structures or from shared commercial/industrial settings loaded onto commons PCs. Each standard deviation increase in PC 1 (organochlorine pesticides, some phenols) and PC 6 (cadmium, bisphenol A) was associated with 0.2 cm (95\% CI: -0.4, 0.0) and 0.1 cm (95\% CI: -0.4, 0.1) lower birth length, respectively. Organochlorine compounds, parabens, and cadmium were inversely associated with birth length in the one-chemical-at-a-time analysis. Cluster membership, PC scores, and individual chemicals were not associated with other birth outcomes. Conclusion: All three methods of characterizing multiple chemical exposures in this cohort identified inverse associations of select organochlorine compounds, phenols, and cadmium with birth length, but not other neonatal outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-persistent chemicals, such as phthalates, environmental phenols, organophosphate pesticides, and others, are challenging to study because of their ubiquity in the environment, diverse exposure routes, and high temporal variability of biomarkers. Nonetheless, there is interest in understanding how gestational exposure to these chemicals may affect fetal growth, as perturbations to normal fetal growth are related to a plethora of adverse health outcomes in childhood and adulthood. Methods: The purpose of this review is to describe the state of the science on this topic. We searched PubMed for studies that included both 1) biomarkers of non-persistent chemicals collected during pregnancy and 2) fetal growth outcomes measured at birth (e.g., birth weight) or by ultrasound in utero (e.g., estimated fetal weight). Results: The bulk of the literature we found uses biomarkers measured at a single time point in pregnancy and birth weight as the primary measure of fetal growth. There is a small, but growing, body of research that uses ultrasound measures to assess fetal growth during pregnancy. In addition to summarizing the findings of the publications we identified, we describe inconsistencies in methodology, areas for improvement, and gaps in existing knowledge that can be targeted for improvement in future work. This literature is characterized by variability in methodology, likely contributing to the inconsistency of results reported. We further discuss maternal, placental, and fetal pathways by which these classes of chemicals may affect fetal growth. Conclusions: To improve understanding of how everyday chemical exposures affect fetal growth, and ultimately lifelong health outcomes, mechanisms of toxicant action should be considered alongside improved study designs for future hypothesis-driven research.},

  abstract = {Parabens have been used in multiple products including personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and foods for more than 50 years but increasing numbers of studies have raised concerns on their safety. The present study was designed to determine urinary paraben levels among pregnant women and their matching newborn infants ({$<$}48 h after delivery), and the association between paraben levels and stress markers. Pregnant women (n=46) and their matching newborn infants were recruited from four university hospitals located in Seoul, Ansan and Jeju of Korea, 2011. Parabens including methyl paraben (MP), ethyl paraben (EP), n-propyl paraben (PP), and n-butyl paraben (BP) were measured in the urine using an automatic, high throughput online SPE-LC-MS/MS method. Urinary concentrations were normalized with specific gravity (SG). Free cortisol, malondealdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured in the urine as stress marker. Urinary MP was detected as the highest, and BP was detected as the lowest paraben in the urine samples of both pregnant women and their infants. Significant correlations between paraben concentrations of maternal and their newborn infant's urine were observed. The levels of urinary parabens among Korean pregnant women are comparable to those reported elsewhere, except for EP which were 4-9 folds higher than pregnant women of other countries. The ratios of infant to maternal urinary paraben concentrations varied between 0.5 and 0.6 for MP and PP, but approximately 10 fold lower for EP. Urinary MP or EP levels were associated with several oxidative stress related biomarkers such as urinary 8-OHdG and MDA, even after the adjustment of relevant covariates such as maternal age, mode of delivery, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age and parity. This is the first study that reported the levels of major parabens in the first urine of newborn infants. Further studies are warranted to understand the implications of paraben exposure among biologically susceptible human populations.},

However, a comprehensive assessment of the role of placental imprinted gene expression on fetal growth has yet to be conducted. In this study, we examined the association between the placental expression of 108 established and putative imprinted genes and birth weight in 677 term pregnancies, oversampled for small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) infants. Using adjusted multinomial regression analyses, a 2-fold increase in the expression of 9 imprinted genes was positively associated with LGA status: BLCAP [odds ratio (OR) = 3.78, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.83, 7.82], DLK1 [OR = 1.63, 95\% CI: 1.27, 2.09], H19 [OR = 2.79, 95\% CI: 1.77, 4.42], IGF2 [OR = 1.43, 95\% CI:1.31, 2.40], MEG3 [OR = 1.42, 95\% CI: 1.19, 1.71], MEST [OR = 4.78, 95\% CI: 2.64, 8.65], NNAT [OR = 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.05, 1.86], NDN [OR = 2.52, 95\% CI: 1.72, 3.68], and PLAGL1 [OR = 1.85, 95\% CI: 1.40, 2.44]. For SGA status, a 2-fold increase in MEST expression was associated with decreased risk [OR = 0.31, 95\% CI: 0.17, 0.58], while a 2-fold increase in NNAT expression was associated with increased risk [OR = 1.52, 95\% CI: 1.1, 2.1]. Following a factor analysis, all genes significantly associated with SGA or LGA status loaded onto 2 of the 8 gene-sets underlying the variability in the dataset. Our comprehensive placental profiling of imprinted genes in a large birth cohort supports the importance of these genes for fetal growth. Given that abnormal birth weight is implicated in numerous diseases and developmental abnormalities, the expression pattern of placental imprinted genes has the potential to be developed as a novel biomarker for postnatal health outcomes.},

These characteristics make genomic imprinting a potentially useful biomarker for environmental insults, especially during the in utero or early development stages, and for health outcomes later in life. Herein, we critically review the current literature regarding environmental influences on imprinted genes and summarize findings that suggest that imprinted loci are sensitive to known teratogenic agents, such as alcohol and tobacco, as well as less established factors with the potential to manipulate the in utero environment, including assisted reproductive technology. Finally, we discuss the potential of genomic imprinting to serve as an environmental sensor during early development.},

FOXE3-FOXD2 (1p33), FOXQ1-FOXF2-FOXC1 (6p25.3), and FOXF1-FOXC2-FOXL1 (16q24.1) loci are FOX gene clusters within the human genome. Members of FOX subfamilies A-G, I-L and Q were grouped into class 1 FOX proteins, while members of FOX subfamilies H and M-P were grouped into class 2 FOX proteins. C-terminal basic region within the FOX domain was the common feature of class 1 FOX proteins. FOXH1 and FOXO1 mRNAs are expressed in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. FOXC1, FOXC2, FOXE1, FOXE3, FOXL2, FOXN1, FOXP2 and FOXP3 genes are mutated in human congenital disorders. FOXA1 gene is amplified and over-expressed in esophageal and lung cancer. FOXM1 gene is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer and basal cell carcinoma due to the transcriptional regulation by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. FOXO1 gene is fused to PAX3 or PAX7 genes in rhabdomyosarcoma. FOXO3 and FOXO4 genes are fused to MLL gene in hematological malignancies. Deregulation of FOX family genes leads to congenital disorders, diabetes mellitus, or carcinogenesis. Expression profiles, genetic alterations and epigenetic changes of FOX family genes as well as binding proteins and target genes of FOX family transcription factors should be comprehensively investigated to develop novel therapeutics and preventives for human diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Whole blood is frequently utilized in genome-wide association studies of DNA methylation patterns in relation to environmental exposures or clinical outcomes. These associations can be confounded by cellular heterogeneity. Algorithms have been developed to measure or adjust for this heterogeneity, and some have been compared in the literature. However, with new methods available, it is unknown whether the findings will be consistent, if not which method(s) perform better. Results: Methods: We compared eight cell-type correction methods including the method in the minfi R package, the method by Houseman et al., the Removing unwanted variation (RUV) approach, the methods in FaST-LMMEWASher, ReFACTor, RefFreeEWAS, and RefFreeCellMix R programs, along with one approach utilizing surrogate variables (SVAs). We first evaluated the association of DNA methylation at each CpG across the whole genome with prenatal arsenic exposure levels and with cancer status, adjusted for estimated cell-type information obtained from different methods. We then compared CpGs showing statistical significance from different approaches. For the methods implemented in minfi and proposed by Houseman et al., we utilized homogeneous data with composition of some blood cells available and compared them with the estimated cell compositions. Finally, for methods not explicitly estimating cell compositions, we evaluated their performance using simulated DNA methylation data with a set of latent variables representing ``cell types''. Results: Results from the SVA-based method overall showed the highest agreement with all other methods except for FaST-LMM-EWASher. Using homogeneous data, minfi provided better estimations on cell types compared to the originally proposed method by Houseman et al. Further simulation studies on methods free of reference data revealed that SVA provided good sensitivities and specificities, RefFreeCellMix in general produced high sensitivities but specificities tended to be low when confounding is present, and FaST-LMM-EWASher gave the lowest sensitivity but highest specificity. Conclusions: Results from real data and simulations indicated that SVA is recommended when the focus is on the identification of informative CpGs. When appropriate reference data are available, the method implemented in the minfi package is recommended. However, if no such reference data are available or if the focus is not on estimating cell proportions, the SVA method is suggested.},

  abstract = {The GNAS locus on chromosome 20q13.11 is the archetypal complex imprinted locus. It comprises a bewildering array of alternative transcripts determined by differentially imprinted promoters which encode distinct proteins. It also provides the classic example of tissue-specific imprinted gene expression, in which the canonical GNAS transcript coding for Gs{$\alpha$} is expressed predominantly from the maternal allele in a set of seemingly unrelated tissues. Functionally, this rather obscure imprinting is nevertheless of considerable clinical significance, as it dictates the nature of the disease caused by inactivating mutations in Gs{$\alpha$}, with end organ hormone resistance specifically on maternal transmission (pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a, PHP1a). In addition, there is a bona fide imprinting disorder, PHP1b, which is caused specifically by DNA methylation defects in the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that determine tissue-specific monoallelic expression of GNAS. Although the genetic defect in PHP1a and the disrupted imprinting in PHP1b both essentially result in profound reduction of Gs{$\alpha$} activity in tissues with monoallelic GNAS expression, and despite a growing awareness of the overlap in these two conditions, there are important pathophysiological differences between the two whose basis is not fully understood. PHP1b is one of the only imprinted gene syndromes in which cis-acting mutations have been discovered that disrupt methylation of germline-derived imprint marks; such imprinting mutations in GNAS are helping to provide important new insights into the mechanisms of imprinting establishment generally. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

METHODS: We examined high-throughput DNA methylation derived from whole blood of 47 females with AN, 47 lean females without AN and 100 population-based females to compare AN with both controls. To account for different cell type compositions, we applied two reference-free methods (FastLMM-EWASher, RefFreeEWAS) and searched for consensus CpG sites identified by both methods. We used a validation sample of five monozygotic AN-discordant twin pairs. RESULTS: Fifty-one consensus sites were identified in AN vs. lean and 81 in AN vs. population-based comparisons. These sites have not been reported in AN methylation analyses, but for the latter comparison 54/81 sites showed directionally consistent differential methylation effects in the AN-discordant twins. For a single nucleotide polymorphism rs923768 in CSGALNACT1 a nearby site was nominally associated with AN. At the gene level, we confirmed hypermethylated sites at TNXB. We found support for a locus at NR1H3 in the AN vs. lean control comparison, but the methylation direction was opposite to the one previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm genes like TNXB previously described to comprise differentially methylated sites, and highlight further sites that might be specifically involved in AN starvation processes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence of neurological, cognitive, and neuropsychological effects of manganese (Mn) exposure from drinking water (WMn) in children has generated widespread public health concern. At elevated exposures, Mn has been associated with increased levels of externalizing behaviors, including irritability, aggression, and impulsivity. Little is known about potential effects at lower exposures, especially in children. Moreover, little is known regarding potential interactions between exposure to Mn and other metals, especially arsenic (As). OBJECTIVES: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 201 children to investigate associations of Mn and As in tube well water with classroom behavior among elementary school children, 8-11 years of age, in Araihazar, Bangladesh. METHODS: Data on exposures and behavioral outcomes were collected from the participants at the baseline of an ongoing longitudinal study of child intelligence. Study children were rated by their school teachers on externalizing and internalizing items of classroom behavior using the standardized Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Report Form (CBCL-TRF). RESULTS: Log-transformed WMn was positively and significantly associated with TRF internalizing [estimated {$\beta$} = 0.82; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.08-1.56; p = 0.03], TRF externalizing (estimated {$\beta$} = 2.59; 95\% CI, 0.81-4.37; p =0.004), and TRF total scores (estimated {$\beta$} = 3.35; 95\% CI, 0.86-5.83; p = 0.008) in models that adjusted for log-transformed water arsenic (WAs) and sociodemographic covariates. We also observed a positive monotonic dose-response relationship between WMn and TRF externalizing and TRF total scores among the participants of the study. We did not find any significant associations between WAs and various scales of TRF scores. CONCLUSION: These observations reinforce the growing concern regarding the neurotoxicologic effects of WMn in children.},

  abstract = {Children born preterm are reported to be at increased risk of developing noncommunicable diseases in later life. Altered placental DNA methylation patterns are implicated in fetal programming of adult diseases. Our earlier animal studies focus on micronutrients (folic acid, vitamin B12) and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) that interact in the I carbon cycle, thereby influencing methylation reactions. Our previous studies in women delivering preterm show altered plasma levels of micronutrients and lower plasma LCPUFA levels. We postulate that alterations in the micronutrient metabolism may affect the regulation of enzymes, methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT2A), and SAH-hydrolase (AHCY), involved in the production of methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), thereby influencing the methylation potential (MP) in the placenta of women delivering preterm. The present study, therefore, examines the mRNA, protein levels of enzymes (MAT2A and AHCY), SAM, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels, and global DNA methylation levels from preterm (n = 73) and term (n = 73) placentae. The enzyme messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and SAM-SAH levels by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mRNA levels for MAT2A and AHCY are higher (P {$<$} .05 for both) in the preterm group as compared to the term group. S-Adenosylmethionine and SAH levels were similar in both groups, although SAM:SAH ratio was lower (P {$<$} .05) in the preterm group as compared to the term group. The global DNA methylation levels were higher (P {$<$} .05) in women delivering small for gestation age infants as compared to women delivering appropriate for gestation age infants at term. Our data showing lower MP in the preterm placenta may have implications for the epigenetic programming of the developing fetus.},

  abstract = {An excessive metal exposure is harmful to the brain. However, many aspects of metal neurotoxicity remain unclear including the magnitude of the low-level exposure effects and the level of exposure that can be assumed safe. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between a low-level metal exposure and three neurobehavioral domains (sustained attention, short-term memory, and manual motor speed). We measured Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Tl in blood, Cd, Ni, and toxicologically relevant As in urine and methyl Hg in hair in 606 adolescents between 13.6 and 17 years of age. A two-fold increase in blood Cu was associated with a 0.37 standard deviations decrease in sustained attention (95\% CI: -0.67 to -0.07, p = 0.02) and 0.39 standard deviations decrease in short-term memory (95\% CI: -0.70 to -0.07, p = 0.02), accounting for gender, age, smoking, passive smoking, household income per capita, occupation of the parents, and education level of the mother. None of the other metals was significantly associated with the neurobehavioral domains that were measured. The observed associations between blood Cu and neurobehavioral performance are in line with recent studies in elderly. However, the relevance of our results for public health remains to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is now compelling evidence that epigenetic modifications link adult disease susceptibility to environmental exposures during specific life stages, including pre-pubertal development. Animal studies indicate that bisphenol A (BPA), the monomer used in epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics, may impact health through epigenetic mechanisms, and epidemiological data associate BPA levels with metabolic disorders, behavior changes, and reproductive effects. Thus, we conducted an environmental epidemiology study of BPA exposure and CpG methylation in pre-adolescent girls from Gharbiah, Egypt hypothesizing that methylation profiles exhibit exposure-dependent trends. METHODS: Urinary concentrations of total (free plus conjugated) species of BPA in spot samples were quantified for 60 girls aged 10 to 13. Genome-wide CpG methylation was concurrently measured in bisulfite-converted saliva DNA using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (N\,=\,46). CpG sites from four candidate genes were validated via quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing. RESULTS: CpG methylation varied widely among girls, and higher urinary BPA concentrations were generally associated with less genomic methylation. Based on pathway analyses, genes exhibiting reduced methylation with increasing urinary BPA were involved in immune function, transport activity, metabolism, and caspase activity. In particular, hypomethylation of CpG targets on chromosome X was associated with higher urinary BPA. Using the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, we identified a number of candidate genes in our sample that previously have been associated with BPA-related expression change. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that BPA may affect human health through specific epigenomic modification of genes in relevant pathways. Thus, epigenetic epidemiology holds promise for the identification of biomarkers from previous exposures and the development of epigenetic-based diagnostic strategies.},

Prenatal mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP) were measured in one urine sample acquired from each mother during the third trimester of pregnancy. Associations with log-transformed creatinine-corrected phthalate concentrations were estimated using linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders., Results: MDI was inversely associated with the natural log concentrations (micrograms per gram creatinine) of MEHHP [{$\beta$} = \textendash 0.97; confidence interval (CI), \textendash 1.85 to \textendash 0.08] and MEOHP ({$\beta$} = \textendash 0.95; CI, \textendash 1.87 to \textendash 0.03), and PDI was inversely associated with MEHHP ({$\beta$} = \textendash 1.20; CI, \textendash 2.33 to \textendash 0.08).

Their total body burden and their contribution to obesity-associated diseases remain unclear. Objectives: We characterized POP total body burden and their redistribution in obese individuals before and after drastic weight loss and compared these values with a variety of molecular, biological, and clinical parameters. Methods: Seventy-one obese subjects were enrolled and underwent bariatric surgery. Blood and adipose tissue samples were obtained at different times from these individuals as well as from 18 lean women. Results: POP content (17 dioxins/furans and 18 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners) in different adipose tissue territories was similar, allowing us to assess total POP body burden from a single biopsy. Total POP body burden was 2 to 3 times higher in obese than in lean individuals. We also found increased expression of some POP target genes in obese adipose tissue. Drastic weight loss led to increased serum POPs and, within 6\textendash 12 months, to a significant 15\% decrease in total polychlorinated biphenyl body burden. Importantly, serum POP levels were positively correlated with liver toxicity markers and lipid parameters, independently of age and body mass index. Conclusions: POP content in adipose tissue and serum correlate with biological markers of obesityrelated dysfunctions. Drastic weight loss leads to a redistribution of POPs and to a moderate decrease of their total body burden.},

  abstract = {Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) has been widely used in sunscreens and many other consumer products, including cosmetics. The widespread use of BP-3 has resulted in its release into the water environment, and hence its potential impact on aquatic ecosystem is of concern. To better understand the risk associated with BP-3 in aquatic ecosystems, we conducted a thorough review of available articles regarding the physicochemical properties, toxicokinetics, environmental occurrence, and toxic effects of BP-3 and its suspected metabolites. BP-3 is lipophilic, photostable, and bioaccumulative, and can be rapidly absorbed via oral and dermal routes. BP-3 is reported to be transformed into three major metabolites in vivo, i.e., benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-8 (BP-8), and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). BP-1 has a longer biological half-life than its parent compound and exhibits greater estrogenic potency in vitro. BP-3 has been detected in water, soil, sediments, sludge, and biota. The maximum detected level in ambient freshwater and seawater is 125ng/L and 577.5ng/L, respectively, and in wastewater influent is 10,400ng/L. The major sources of BP-3 are reported to be human recreational activities and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. BP-3 and its derivatives have been also detected in fish lipid. In humans, BP-3 has been detected in urine, serum, and breast milk samples worldwide. BP-1 has also been detected in placental tissues of delivering women. While sunscreens and cosmetics are known to be major sources of exposure, the fact that BP-3 has been detected frequently among young children and men suggests other sources. An increasing number of in vitro studies have indicated the endocrine disrupting capacity of BP-3. Based on a receptor binding assay, BP-3 has shown strong anti-androgenic and weak estrogenic activities but at the same time BP-3 displays anti-estrogenic activity as well. Predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) for BP-3 was derived at 1.32{$\mu$}g/L. The levels observed in ambient water are generally an order of magnitude lower than the PNEC, but in wastewater influents, hazard quotients (HQs) greater than 1 were noted. Considering limited ecotoxicological information and significant seasonal and spatial variations of BP-3 in water, further studies on environmental monitoring and potential consequences of long-term exposure in aquatic ecosystem are warranted.},

Several chemicals have been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental disorders in the early life stages of humans. However, most epidemiological studies have focused on a limited number of chemicals, and hence may exclude important chemicals from consideration or result in conclusions built on associations by chance. In the present study, we investigated the chemical exposure profile of the women, and associated these with the early neurodevelopmental performance of their offspring at 13-24months of age. The chemicals assessed include four phthalates, bisphenol A, three heavy metals, 19 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 19 organochlorine pesticides, and 19 polybrominated diphenyl ethers, which were measured from urine, whole blood, serum, and/or breastmilk of the pregnant or lactating women. For neurodevelopmental performance, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II (BSID-II), Social Maturity Scale (SMS), and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were measured from a total of 140 toddlers. Among the measured chemicals, monoethyl phthalate (MEP) in maternal urine was significantly associated with early mental, psychomotor, and social development. In addition, breast milk di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolite and blood lead concentrations were inversely associated with mental and psychomotor development indices, respectively. Maternal blood PCB153, heavy metals, and urinary MEP levels were also higher among the children with behavioral problems, as indicated by the CBCL range. Taken together, maternal exposure to several EDCs such as PCBs and DEHP was associated with adverse neurodevelopmental performances among the children aged 1-2years. Confirmation of these association in larger populations, as well as longer-term consequences of such exposure warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {The European Commission asked EFSA for a scientific evaluation on the risks to human health related to the presence of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in food. Regarding PFOS and PFOA occurrence, the final data set available for dietary exposure assessment contained a total of 20,019 analytical results (PFOS n = 10,191 and PFOA n = 9,828). There were large differences between upper and lower bound exposure due to analytical methods with insufficient sensitivity. The CONTAM Panel considered the lower bound estimates to be closer to true exposure levels. Important contributors to the lower bound mean chronic exposure were `Fish and other seafood', `Meat and meat products' and `Eggs and egg products', for PFOS, and `Milk and dairy products', `Drinking water' and `Fish and other seafood' for PFOA. PFOS and PFOA are readily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, excreted in urine and faeces, and do not undergo metabolism. Estimated human half-lives for PFOS and PFOA are about 5 years and 2\textendash 4 years, respectively. The derivation of a health-based guidance value was based on human epidemiological studies. For PFOS, the increase in serum total cholesterol in adults, and the decrease in antibody response at vaccination in children were identified as the critical effects. For PFOA, the increase in serum total cholesterol was the critical effect. Also reduced birth weight (for both compounds) and increased prevalence of high serum levels of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (for PFOA) were considered. After benchmark modelling of serum levels of PFOS and PFOA, and estimating the corresponding daily intakes, the CONTAM Panel established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 13 ng/kg body weight (bw) per week for PFOS and 6 ng/kg bw per week for PFOA. For both compounds, exposure of a considerable proportion of the population exceeds the proposed TWIs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is concern over potential neurobehavioral effects of prenatal phthalate exposures, but available data are inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We examined associations between prenatal urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites and neurobehavioral scores among children. METHODS: We measured phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine samples from 153 pregnant participants in the Study for Future Families, a multicenter cohort study. Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist when the children were 6-10 years of age. We estimated overall and sex-specific associations between phthalate concentrations and behavior using adjusted multiple regression interaction models. RESULTS: In boys, concentrations of monoisobutyl phthalate were associated with higher scores for inattention ({$\beta$} = 0.27; 95\% CI: 0.04, 0.50), rule-breaking behavior ({$\beta$} = 0.20; 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.38), aggression ({$\beta$} = 0.34; 95\% CI: 0.09, 0.59), and conduct problems ({$\beta$} = 0.39; 95\% CI: 0.20, 0.58), whereas the molar sum of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites was associated with higher scores for somatic problems ({$\beta$} = 0.15; 95\% CI: 0.03, 0.28). Higher monobenzyl phthalate concentrations were associated with higher scores for oppositional behavior ({$\beta$} = 0.16; 95\% CI: 0.01, 0.32) and conduct problems ({$\beta$} = 0.21; 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.37) in boys, but with reduced anxiety scores in girls ({$\beta$} = -0.20; 95\% CI: -0.39, -0.01). In general, the associations reported above were close to the null among girls. Model coefficients represent the difference in the square root-transformed outcome score associated with a 1-unit increase in log-transformed metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest associations between exposure to certain phthalates in late pregnancy and behavioral problems in boys. Given the few studies on this topic and methodological and population differences among studies, additional research is warranted.},

  abstract = {In modern societies, living organisms are exposed daily to multiform pollution from industrial chemical products. Some of these substances have been shown to affect the endocrine system, and have been termed endocrine disruptors (EDs). Bisphenol A (BPA), which can leach from plastics, and parabens, used in cosmetic products, are among the most well-studied. Prenatal development is a vulnerable phase of human life, and disruptions during this period may have lifelong consequences. Since EDs are known to cross the placental barrier and BPA may accumulate in the fetus, ``BPA-free'' products have been introduced to the market. However, such products often contain alternative bisphenols (e.g. BPS, BPF) that have not yet been extensively examined or regulated. Moreover, alternative bisphenols often occur together with BPA. The human organism is thus exposed to a mixture of EDs, some of which can have additive or synergic effects. Recent findings have also shown that paraben exposure can alter bisphenol pharmacokinetics. Taking into account the widespread occurrence of various EDs and the potential multiplicity of their effects, doses of EDs currently considered safe may not actually be as safe as they appear, especially during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Background The harmful effects of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on human health are generally well-known, and exposure during fetal development may have lasting effects. Fetal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been recently relatively well-studied; however, less is known about alternatives such as bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol AF (BPAF), which have started to appear in consumer products. Parabens are another widespread group of EDCs, with confirmed transplacental passage. The usage of many cosmetic, pharmaceutical and consumer products during the pregnancy that may contain parabens and bisphenols has led to the need for investigation. Objectives To shed more light into the transplacental transport of BPA, its alternatives, and parabens, and to study their relation to fetal steroidogenesis. Methods BPA, BPS, BPF, BPAF, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, benzylparaben and 15 steroids including estrogens, corticoids, androgens and immunomodulatory ones were determined in 27 maternal (37th week of pregnancy) and cord plasma samples using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry methods. Results In cord blood, significantly higher BPA levels (p=0.0455) were observed compared to maternal plasma. The results from multiple regression models showed that in cord blood, methylparaben ({$\beta$}=-0.027, p=0.027), propylparaben ({$\beta$}=-0.025, p=0.03) and the sum of all measured parabens ({$\beta$}=-0.037, p=0.015) were inversely associated with testosterone levels. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the simultaneous detection of BPA, alternative bisphenols, parabens and steroids in maternal and cord plasma. Our study confirmed the transplacental transport of BPA, with likely accumulation in the fetal compartment. The negative association of cord blood parabens and testosterone levels points to possible risks with respect to importance of testosterone for prenatal male development.},

One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach.},

Prenatal administration of bisphenol A (BPA) induces histologic anomalies in the dorsal telencephalon of the embryo. Whether these anomalies affect the morphogenesis and maturation of neuronal function of the newborn neocortex, however, is unknown. To evaluate the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of prenatal BPA exposure at 20 and 200{$\mu$}g/kg/day in newborn mice, we performed a detailed histologic analysis of the neocortex and tested for the presence of behavioral abnormalities in newborn mice prenatally exposed to BPA using our newly developed behavioral test. Observations of newborn mice prenatally exposed to BPA revealed abnormal neuronal distribution and layer formation, hypoplasia of layer 6b, and abnormal dopaminergic neuronal projections in the neocortex. Further, the newborn mice exhibited hyperactivity. These findings suggest that prenatal BPA exposure induces neurobehavioral toxicity associated with abnormal dopaminergic neuronal projections, and abnormal corticogenesis and lamination. Histologic and behavioral analyses of newborn mice are considered useful for assessing the neurodevelopmental and behavioral toxicity of chemicals.},

Subjects were interviewed using questionnaires regarding their demographic characteristics, educational background, and work and home activities related to pesticide exposures. Spot urine samples were collected at 28 weeks gestation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine maternal metabolite levels of organophosphate pesticides including dimethyl phosphate (DMP); total DEP (diethyl phosphate (DEP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP), and total DAP (the sum of all metabolite levels). At five months of age, infant development was evaluated using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III). Higher total DEP and total DAP metabolite levels from the mother at 28 weeks' gestation were significantly associated with reduced motor composite scores on the Bayley-III at five months of age. The total DEP levels were also significantly associated with reduced cognitive composite scores. Prenatal concentrations of maternal urinary metabolites were associated with infant cognitive and motor development. The results of several studies now suggest the need for public health intervention to reduce prenatal pesticide exposures from both agricultural and domestic use.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) belongs to chemicals that are produced in large quantities worldwide. It is commonly used as monomer in polycarbonate synthesis, plasticizer in the production of epoxy resins, as well as an additive for the elimination of surfeit of hydrochloric acid during the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production. BPA is not only used in the production of plastics intended to a direct contact with food, including plastic packaging and kitchenware, but also in inner coatings of cans and jar caps. There are various routes of human exposure to this substance such as oral, by inhalation and transdermal. The main sources of exposure to BPA include food packaging and dust, dental materials, healthcare equipment, thermal paper, toys and articles for children and infants. BPA is metabolized in the liver to form bisphenol A glucuronide and mostly in this form is excreted with urine. Due to its phenolic structure BPA has been shown to interact with estrogen receptors and to act as agonist or antagonist via estrogen receptor (ER) dependent signalling pathways. Therefore, BPA has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of several endocrine disorders including female and male infertility, precocious puberty, hormone dependent tumours such as breast and prostate cancer and several metabolic disorders including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Because of the constant, daily exposure and its tendency to bio-accumulation, BPA seems to require special attention such as biomonitoring. This observation should include clinical tests of BPA concentration in the urine, which is not only one of the best methods of evaluation of the exposure to this compound, but also the dependence of the daily intake of BPA and the risk of some endocrine disorders.},

Sample pretreatment starts with dispersive solid phase extraction of POPs to dichloromethane-hexane, which is immediately poured to cleanup column. POPs are eluted from column and concentrated for GC-MS/MS analysis. PFAAs are trapped to dispersant and are then extracted with ammonium acetate in methanol, concentrated and analysed with LC-MS/MS. For POPs, the limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 1.6 to 17pg/ml. Oxychlordane and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane had LODs in the upper end of this range as they were more labile and prone for interferences in the GC-MS/MS. For PFAAs, the LOD range from 0.027 to 0.068ng/ml. For POPs, the accuracy from Standard Reference Materials SRM 1589a and Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) intercalibration samples range from 74 to 127\% and the repeatability (relative standard deviation, RSD\%) from 2.0 to 15\%. For PFAAs, the accuracy from AMAP samples ranged from 90 to 110\% and from LOQ level spiked serum samples from 72 to 133\%.

We have recently shown that a very broad spectrum of placental abnormalities associated with altered imprinted gene expression occurs in the absence of the oocyte-derived DNMT1o cytosine methyltransferase, which normally maintains parent-specific imprinted methylation during preimplantation. The absence of DNMT1o partially reduces inherited imprinted methylation while retaining the genetic integrity of imprinted genes and their ICRs. Using this novel system, we undertook a broad and inclusive approach to identifying key ICRs involved in placental development by correlating loss of imprinted DNA methylation with abnormal placental phenotypes in a mid-gestation window (E12.5-E15.5). To these ends we measured DNA CpG methylation at 15 imprinted gametic differentially methylated domains (gDMDs) that overlap known ICRs using EpiTYPER-mass array technology, and linked these epigenetic measurements to histomorphological defects. Methylation of some imprinted gDMDs, most notably Dlk1, was nearly normal in mid-gestation DNMT1o-deficient placentas, consistent with the notion that cells having lost methylation on these DMDs do not contribute significantly to placental development. Most imprinted gDMDs however showed a wide range of methylation loss among DNMT1o-deficient placentas. Two striking associations were observed. First, loss of DNA methylation at the Peg10 imprinted gDMD associated with decreased embryonic viability and decreased labyrinthine volume. Second, loss of methylation at the Kcnq1 imprinted gDMD was strongly associated with trophoblast giant cell (TGC) expansion. We conclude that the Peg10 and Kcnq1 ICRs are key regulators of mid-gestation placental function.},

  abstract = {Repulsive guidance molecule member a (RGMa) is a membrane-associated or released guidance molecule that is involved in axon guidance, cell patterning, and cell survival. In our previous work, we showed that RGMa is significantly upregulated in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease. Here we demonstrate the expression of RGMa in midbrain human dopaminergic (DA) neurons. To investigate whether RGMa might model aspects of the neuropathology of Parkinson's disease in mouse, we targeted RGMa to adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons using adeno-associated viral vectors. Overexpression of RGMa resulted in a progressive movement disorder, including motor coordination and imbalance, which is typical for a loss of DA release in the striatum. In line with this, RGMa induced selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and affected the integrity of the nigrostriatal system. The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by a strong microglia and astrocyte activation. The behavioral, molecular, and anatomical changes induced by RGMa in mice are remarkably similar to the clinical and neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease. Our data indicate that dysregulation of RGMa plays an important role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease, and antibody-mediated functional interference with RGMa may be a disease modifying treatment option. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by severe motor dysfunction due to progressive degeneration of mesencephalic dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. To date, there is no regenerative treatment available. We previously showed that repulsive guidance molecule member a (RGMa) is upregulated in the substantia nigra of PD patients. Adeno-associated virus-mediated targeting of RGMa to mouse DA neurons showed that overexpression of this repulsive axon guidance and cell patterning cue models the behavioral and neuropathological characteristics of PD in a remarkable way. These findings have implications for therapy development as interfering with the function of this specific axon guidance cue may be beneficial to the survival of DA neurons.},

  abstract = {Throughout in utero development, the placenta plays a key role in controlling growth and development. The placenta acts not only as a gatekeeper of nutrient and waste exchange between mother and developing fetus, but also as a regulator of the intrauterine environment. Its functions can be influenced by the environment encountered throughout pregnancy, thereby altering the appropriate genetic programming needed to allow for appropriate fetal growth. Epigenetic alterations related to environmental exposures have been linked to aberrant fetal growth. DNA methylation, which is the best known DNA epigenetic modification, may provide an attractive mechanism linking environmental cues to placental pathology, with consequences for fetal growth and adult life. Alteration of the methylation patterns of genes expressed in the placenta has recently been found to modify gene expression and subsequently impair function of the placenta. Although there is strong evidence to demonstrate that the environment can affect the pattern of DNA methylation of the placenta during fetal development, a direct association between environmental conditions, methylation alterations and gene expression is difficult to confirm. DNA methylation in the placenta has mainly been investigated in the context of imprinted and non-imprinted genes transcription. Several environmental factors have also been assessed in regard to their association with changes to the epigenetic motives of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues and their impact on pregnancy outcome. In this review, we briefly present the available evidence regarding the role of DNA methylation patterns of the placenta on aberrant fetal growth.},

  abstract = {Background: Graphical Gaussian models are popular tools for the estimation of (undirected) gene association networks from microarray data. A key issue when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples is the estimation of the matrix of partial correlations. Since the (Moore-Penrose) inverse of the sample covariance matrix leads to poor estimates in this scenario, standard methods are inappropriate and adequate regularization techniques are needed. Popular approaches include biased estimates of the covariance matrix and highdimensional regression schemes, such as the Lasso and Partial Least Squares. Results: In this article, we investigate a general framework for combining regularized regression methods with the estimation of Graphical Gaussian models. This framework includes various existing methods as well as two new approaches based on ridge regression and adaptive lasso, respectively. These methods are extensively compared both qualitatively and quantitatively within a simulation study and through an application to six diverse real data sets. In addition, all proposed algorithms are implemented in the R package "parcor", available from the R repository CRAN. Conclusion: In our simulation studies, the investigated non-sparse regression methods, i.e. Ridge Regression and Partial Least Squares, exhibit rather conservative behavior when combined with (local) false discovery rate multiple testing in order to decide whether or not an edge is present in the network. For networks with higher densities, the difference in performance of the methods decreases. For sparse networks, we confirm the Lasso's well known tendency towards selecting too many edges, whereas the two-stage adaptive Lasso is an interesting alternative that provides sparser solutions. In our simulations, both sparse and non-sparse methods are able to reconstruct networks with cluster structures. On six real data sets, we also clearly distinguish the results obtained using the non-sparse methods and those obtained using the sparse methods where specification of the regularization parameter automatically means model selection. In five out of six data sets, Partial Least Squares selects very dense networks. Furthermore, for data that violate the assumption of uncorrelated observations (due to replications), the Lasso and the adaptive Lasso yield very complex structures, indicating that they might not be suited under these conditions. The shrinkage approach is more stable than the regression based approaches when using subsampling.},

Methods Prospective study of 183 pregnant women with 2nd trimester serum and urine samples available. Maternal concentrations of the chemical UV filters benzophenone-1 (BP-1) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) in urine and 4-hydroxy-benzophenone (4-HBP) in serum were measured by liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometry (LC\textendash MS/MS).

Objectives To examine whether benzophenones present in pregnant women pass through the placental barrier to amniotic fluid and further to the fetal blood circulation. Methods A prospective study of 200 pregnant women with simultaneously collected paired samples of amniotic fluid and maternal serum and urine. In addition, unique samples of human fetal blood (n=4) obtained during cordocentesis: and cord blood (n=23) obtained at delivery, both with paired maternal samples of serum and urine collected simultaneously, were used. All biological samples were analyzed by TurboFlow-liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry for seven different benzophenones. Results Benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 4-methyl-benzophenone (4-MBP), and 4-hydroxy-benzophenone (4-HBP) were all detectable in amniotic fluid and cord blood samples and except 4-HBP also in fetal blood; albeit at a low frequency. BP-1 and BP-3 were measured at \textasciitilde 10-times lower concentrations in fetal and cord blood compared to maternal serum and 1000-times lower concentration compared to maternal urine levels. Therefore BP-1 and BP-3 were only detectable in the fetal circulation in cases of high maternal exposure indicating some protection by the placental barrier. 4-MBP seems to pass into fetal and cord blood more freely with a median 1:3 ratio between cord blood and maternal serum levels. Only for BP-3, which the women seemed to be most exposed to, did the measured concentrations in maternal urine and serum correlate to concentrations measured in amniotic fluid. Thus, for BP-3, but not for the other tested benzophenones, maternal urinary levels seem to be a valid proxy for fetal exposure. Conclusions Detectable levels of several of the investigated benzophenones in human amniotic fluid as well as in fetal and cord blood calls for further investigations of the toxicokinetic and potential endocrine disrupting properties of these compounds in order for better assessment of the risk to the developing fetus.},

  abstract = {More than half the pregnant women in the Western world report taking mild analgesics. These pharmaceutical compounds have been associated with congenital cryptorchidism in humans, the best-known risk factor for low semen quality and testicular germ cell cancer. Furthermore, some of these mild analgesics exert potent anti-androgenic effects in the male rat and several endocrine-disrupting compounds, known to alter masculinization, have also been shown to be potent inhibitors of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis similar to mild analgesics. Using a 3-day ex vivo organotypic model system based on gestational day 14.5 rat testes, we herein show that testosterone production was inhibited by paracetamol, at doses of 0.1 {$\mu$}m to 100 {$\mu$}m. Similar results were obtained for aspirin (1\textendash 100 {$\mu$}m) and indomethacin (10 {$\mu$}m). The production of the other Leydig cell hormone, Insl3, was not disrupted by exposure to paracetamol. Investigations of the gross anatomy of the testis as well as Leydig cells number and rate of gonocyte apoptosis after the 3 days of ex vivo differentiation showed no significant effect of the analgesics tested compared with controls. These data indicate therefore that mild analgesics specifically inhibit testosterone production in rat foetal testes in vitro and that these compounds had no effect on gonocyte survival. Parallel determinations of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) production indicated that the effects of paracetamol and aspirin on PGD2 and testosterone were not connected, whereas the effects of indomethacin were correlated. We conclude that mild analgesics exert direct and specific anti-androgenic effects in rat foetal testis in our experimental setup and that the mechanism of action is probably uncoupled from the inhibition of PG synthesis.},

Several studies have shown that mild analgesics exposure during fetal life is associated with antiandrogenic effects and congenital malformations, but the effects on the adult man remain largely unknown. Through a clinical trial with young men exposed to ibuprofen, we show that the analgesic resulted in the clinical condition named ``compensated hypogonadism," a condition prevalent among elderly men and associated with reproductive and physical disorders. In the men, luteinizing hormone (LH) and ibuprofen plasma levels were positively correlated, and the testosterone/LH ratio decreased. Using adult testis explants exposed or not exposed to ibuprofen, we demonstrate that the endocrine capabilities from testicular Leydig and Sertoli cells, including testosterone production, were suppressed through transcriptional repression. This effect was also observed in a human steroidogenic cell line. Our data demonstrate that ibuprofen alters the endocrine system via selective transcriptional repression in the human testes, thereby inducing compensated hypogonadism.},

Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. METHODS: We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. RESULTS: We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic environmental toxin widely used in the production of plastics and ubiquitous human exposure to this chemical has been proposed to be a potential risk to public health. Animal studies suggest that in utero and early postnatal exposure to this compound may produce a broad range of adverse effects, including impaired brain development, sexual differentiation, behavior, and immune function, which could extend to future generations. Molecular mechanisms that underlie the long-lasting effects of BPA continue to be elucidated, and likely involve disruption of epigenetic programming of gene expression during development. Several studies have provided evidence that maternal exposure to BPA results in postnatal changes in DNA methylation status and altered expression of specific genes in offspring. However, further studies are needed to extend these initial findings to other genes in different tissues, and to examine the correlations between BPA-induced epigenetic alterations, changes in gene expression, and various phenotypic outcomes. It will be also important to explore whether the epigenetic effects of BPA are related to its estrogenic activity, and to determine which downstream effector proteins could mediate changes in DNA methylation. In this review, we will highlight research indicating a consequence of prenatal BPA exposure for brain, behavior, and immune outcomes and discuss evidence for the role of epigenetic pathways in shaping these developmental effects. Based on this evidence, we will suggest future directions in the study of BPA-induced epigenetic effects and discuss the transgenerational implications of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals.},

In humans, although there is evidence for DNA methylation changes in the peripheral blood of psychiatric patients, a fundamental question remains as to whether epigenetic markers in the blood can predict epigenetic changes occurring in the brain. We used in utero bisphenol A (BPA) exposure as a model environmental exposure shown to disrupt neurodevelopment and exert long-term effects on behavior in animals and humans. We show that prenatal BPA induces lasting DNA methylation changes in the transcriptionally relevant region of the               Bdnf               gene in the hippocampus and blood of BALB/c mice and that these changes are consistent with               BDNF               changes in the cord blood of humans exposed to high maternal BPA levels in utero. Our data suggest that               BDNF               DNA methylation in the blood may be used as a predictor of brain               BDNF               DNA methylation and gene expression as well as behavioral vulnerability induced by early-life environmental exposure. Because               BDNF               expression and DNA methylation are altered in several psychiatric disorders that are associated with early-life adversity, including depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism,               BDNF               DNA methylation in the blood may represent a novel biomarker for the early detection of psychopathology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is associated with allergy, chronic inflammation, and immunodeficiency. Phthalates, the common EDCs used in plastic industry, may act as adjuvants to disrupt immune system and enhance allergy. Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are predominant cells secreting type I interferon (IFN) against infection and are professional antigen-presenting cells in regulating adaptive immunity. However, the effects of phthalates on the function of pDCs are unknown. METHODS: Circulating pDCs were isolated from healthy subjects, were pretreated with diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and were stimulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9 agonist CpG. IFN-{$\alpha$}/IFN-{$\beta$} levels, surface markers, and T-cell stimulatory function were investigated using ELISA, flow cytometry, and pDC/T-cell coculture assay. Mechanisms were investigated using receptor antagonists, pathway inhibitors, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Diethylhexyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate suppressed CpG-induced IFN-{$\alpha$}/IFN-{$\beta$} expression in pDCs, and the effect was reversed by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonist. Diethylhexyl phthalate suppressed CpG-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-MEK1/2-ERK-ELK1 and NF{$\kappa$}B signaling pathways. Diethylhexyl phthalate suppressed CpG-induced interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7 expression by suppressing histone H3K4 trimethylation at IRF7 gene promoter region through inhibiting translocation of H3K4-specific trimethyltransferase WDR5 from cytoplasm into nucleus. Butyl benzyl phthalate or diethylhexyl phthalate-treated pDCs suppressed IFN-{$\gamma$} but enhanced IL-13 production by CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSION: Phthalates may interfere with immunity against infection and promote the deviation of Th2 response to increase allergy by acting on human pDCs via suppressing IFN-{$\alpha$}/IFN-{$\beta$} expression and modulating the ability to stimulate T-cell responses.},

With the rise of the internet it has become easier to preregister the theoretical and empirical basis for predictions, the experimental design, the materials, and the analysis code. Whether the practice of preregistration is valuable depends on your philosophy of science. Here, I provide a conceptual analysis of the value of preregistration for psychological science from an error statistical philosophy (Mayo, 2018). Preregistration has the goal to allow others to transparently evaluate the capacity of a test to falsify a prediction, or the severity of a test. Researchers who aim to test predictions with severity should find value in the practice of preregistration. I differentiate the goal of preregistration from positive externalities, discuss how preregistration itself does not make a study better or worse compared to a non-preregistered study, and highlight the importance of evaluating the usefulness of a tool such as preregistration based on an explicit consideration of your philosophy of science.},

Phthalates and phenols are two classes of suspected EDCs that are used in a variety of everyday consumer products, including plastics, epoxy resins, and cosmetics. In utero exposure to EDCs may affect disease propensity through epigenetic mechanisms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether prenatal exposure to multiple EDCs is associated with changes in miRNA expression of human placenta, and whether miRNA alterations are associated with birth outcomes. METHODS: Our study was restricted to a total of 179 women co-enrolled in the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort and the Predictors of Preeclampsia Study. We analyzed associations between first-trimester urine concentrations of 8 phenols and 11 phthalate metabolites and expression of 29 candidate miRNAs in placenta by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: For three miRNAs--miR-142-3p, miR15a-5p, and miR-185--we detected associations between {$\Sigma$}phthalates or {$\Sigma$}phenols on expression levels (p {$<$} 0.05). By assessing gene ontology enrichment, we determined the potential mRNA targets of these microRNAs predicted in silico were associated with several biological pathways, including the regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity. Four gene ontology biological processes were enriched among genes significantly correlated with the expression of miRNAs associated with EDC burden. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that prenatal phenol and phthalate exposure is associated with altered miRNA expression in placenta, suggesting a potential mechanism of EDC toxicity in humans.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triclosan (TCS) is widely used as an antibacterial agent in consumer products such as hand soap and toothpaste, and human exposure is widespread. TCS is suspected of having endocrine-disrupting properties, but few human studies have examined the developmental effects of prenatal TCS exposure. OBJECTIVES: We prospectively examined associations between prenatal TCS exposure and anthropometric measures at birth and anogenital distance (AGD) at 3 months of age. METHODS: Pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort (n = 514) provided urine samples at approximately gestational week 28 (median 28.7 weeks, range 26.4-34.0), and urinary TCS concentration was measured by isotope dilution TurboFlow-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine associations between prenatal TCS exposure and measures of size at birth (birth weight, length, head and abdominal circumference) and AGD at 3 months of age (median 3.3 months, range 2.3-6.7 months), controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: Newborn boys in the highest quartile of prenatal TCS exposure had a 0.7-cm [95\% confidence interval (CI): -1.2, -0.1, p = 0.01] smaller head circumference than boys in the lowest quartile. Additionally in boys, inverse associations of borderline statistical significance were observed between prenatal TCS exposure and abdominal circumference at birth and AGD at 3 months of age (p-values {$<$} 0.10). Prenatal TCS exposure was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes in girls. However, AGD was measured in fewer girls, and we observed no significant interactions between a child's sex and prenatal TCS exposure in anthropometric measures at birth. CONCLUSION: Prenatal TCS exposure was associated with reduced head and abdominal circumference at birth and with reduced AGD at 3 months of age in boys, although the last two findings were statistically nonsignificant. These findings require replication but are compatible with an anti-androgenic effect of prenatal TCS exposure on fetal growth in boys.

Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundant phthalate in the environment. Humans are exposed to these compounds through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure for their whole lifetime, since the intrauterine life. Public and scientific concern has increased in recent years about the potential health risks associated with exposure to phthalates. The main focus has moved away from the hepatotoxic effects to the endocrine disrupting potency of these chemicals. To date, although the consistent toxicologic data on phthalates is suggestive, information on sources and pathways of human exposure to phthalates is limited. Recently, exposure to phthalates has been assessed by analyzing urine for their metabolites. This approach is contrary to the determination of the parent phthalates in air, water and foodstuff and not subject to contamination. Furthermore, these metabolites and the parent phthalates are considered the toxic species. However, accurate methods and models for measuring the amount of phthalates absorbed by the various pathways of exposure have to be developed. In fact, a frequent biological monitoring of phthalates in body fluids and tissues would be highly advisable, both in helping physicians to perform health risk assessments for exposure in the general population and in guiding governments to provide regulations concerning the maximum allowed concentrations in the environment, plasticized products, medications and medical equipment.},

This prospective birth cohort study probed the previously observed association between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopment by using concentrations of acetaminophen measured in meconium, which more objectively captures exposure of the fetus than maternal report. Exposure, measured by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry, was categorized into nondetection, low detection, and high detection levels. At age 6\textendash 8 years, children completed a set of subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition. Additionally, this study examined potential effect modification by child sex on the association between acetaminophen exposure and neurodevelopment. In fully adjusted models, in utero exposure to acetaminophen was not statistically significantly associated with decreased scores on any of the examined subtests in all children combined (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 118). The effect of in utero acetaminophen exposure on the Coding subtest was marginally significantly different among boys and girls, with girls performing significantly better on the task with higher levels of acetaminophen compared with girls with undetectable levels of exposure (bgirls, low {$\frac{1}{4}$} 2.83 [0.97, 4.70], bgirls, high {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.95 [\`A0.03, 3.93], bboys, low {$\frac{1}{4}$} .02 [\`A1.78, 1.81], bboys, high {$\frac{1}{4}$} \`A.39 [\`A2.09, 1.31], pinteraction {$\frac{1}{4}$} .06).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical developmental windows have been implicated in the etiologies of a wide array of adverse perinatal and pediatric outcomes. Epidemiological studies have concentrated on the health effects of individual chemicals, despite the understanding that EDCs act together via common mechanisms, that pregnant women are exposed to multiple EDCs simultaneously, and that substantial toxicological evidence of adverse developmental effects has been documented. There is a move toward multipollutant models in environmental epidemiology; however, there is no current consensus on appropriate statistical methods. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review the statistical methods used in these studies, to identify additional applicable methods, and to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each method for addressing the salient statistical and epidemiological challenges. METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for epidemiological studies of endocrine-sensitive outcomes in the children of mothers exposed to EDC mixtures during pregnancy and identified alternative statistical methods from the wider literature. DISCUSSION: We identified 74 studies and analyzed the methods used to estimate mixture health effects, identify important mixture components, account for nonmonotonicity in exposure\textendash response relationships, assess interactions, and identify windows of exposure susceptibility. We identified both frequentist and Bayesian methods that are robust to multicollinearity, performing shrinkage, variable selection, dimension reduction, statistical learning, or smoothing, including methods that were not used by the studies included in our review. CONCLUSIONS: Compelling motivation exists for analyzing EDCs as mixtures, yet many studies make simplifying assumptions about EDC additivity, relative potency, and linearity, or overlook the potential for bias due to asymmetries in chemical persistence. We discuss the potential impacts of these choices and suggest alternative methods to improve analyses of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2207},

Non-monotonic relationships are increasingly recognised (e.g., for endocrine-disrupting chemicals); however, the impact of nonmonotonicity on exposure selection has not been evaluated. In a simulation study, we assessed the performance of Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), Bayesian structured additive regression with spike\textendash slab priors (BSTARSS), and lasso penalised regression. We used data on exposure to 12 phthalates and phenols in pregnant women from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to simulate realistic exposure data using a multivariate copula. We simulated datasets of size N = 250 and compared methods across 32 scenarios, varying by model size and sparsity, signal-to-noise ratio, correlation structure, and exposure\textendash response relationship shapes. We compared methods in terms of their sensitivity, specificity, and estimation accuracy. In most scenarios, BKMR and BSTARSS achieved moderate to high specificity (0.56\textendash 0.91 and 0.57\textendash 0.96, respectively) and sensitivity (0.49\textendash 0.98 and 0.25\textendash 0.97, respectively). BART achieved high specificity ({$\geq$} 0.96), but low to moderate sensitivity (0.13\textendash 0.66). Lasso was highly sensitive (0.75\textendash 0.99), except for symmetric inverse-U-shaped relationships ({$\leq$} 0.2). Performance was affected by the signal-to-noise ratio, but not substantially by the correlation structure. Penalised regression methods that assume linearity, such as lasso, may not be suitable for studies of environmental chemicals hypothesised to have non-monotonic relationships with outcomes. Instead, BKMR and BSTARSS are attractive methods for flexibly estimating the shapes of exposure\textendash response relationships and selecting among correlated exposures.},

  abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic compounds that travel with lipids and accumulate mainly in adipose tissue. Recent human evidence links low-dose POPs to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Because humans are contaminated by POP mixtures and POPs possibly have nonmonotonic dose-response relations with T2D, critical methodological issues arise in evaluating human findings. This review summarizes epidemiological results on chlorinated POPs and T2D, and relevant experimental evidence. It also discusses how features of POPs can affect inferences in humans. The evidence as a whole suggests that, rather than a few individual POPs, background exposure to POP mixtures-including organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls-can increase T2D risk in humans. Inconsistent statistical significance for individual POPs may arise due to distributional differences in POP mixtures among populations. Differences in the observed shape of the dose-response curves among human studies may reflect an inverted U-shaped association secondary to mitochondrial dysfunction or endocrine disruption. Finally, we examine the relationship between POPs and obesity. There is evidence in animal studies that low-dose POP mixtures are obesogenic. However, relationships between POPs and obesity in humans have been inconsistent. Adipose tissue plays a dual role of promoting T2D and providing a relatively safe place to store POPs. Large prospective studies with serial measurements of a broad range of POPs, adiposity, and clinically relevant biomarkers are needed to disentangle the interrelationships among POPs, obesity, and the development of T2D. Also needed are laboratory experiments that more closely mimic real-world POP doses, mixtures, and exposure duration in humans.},

  abstract = {Although low doses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), strong lipophilic chemicals with long half-lives, have been linked to various endocrine, immune, nervous and reproductive system diseases, few obesity studies have considered adipose tissue as an important POPs exposure source. Because the toxicodynamics of POPs relate directly to the dynamics of adiposity, POPs might explain puzzling findings in obesity research. In two people exposed to the same amounts of environmental POPs, the one having more adipose tissue may be advantaged because POPs storage in adipose tissue can reduce burden on other critical organs. Therefore, adipose tissue can play a protective role against the POPs effects. However, two situations increase the POPs release from adipose tissue into the circulation, thereby increasing the risk that they will reach critical organs: (i) weight loss and (ii) insulin resistance. In contrast, weight gain reduces this possibility. Therefore, avoiding harmful health effects of POPs may mostly contradict conventional judgments about obesity and weight change. These contradictory situations can explain the obesity paradox, the adverse effects of intensive intentional weight loss and the protective effects of obesity against dementia. Future studies should consider that adipose tissue is widely contaminated with POPs in modern society.},

Here, we investigated a novel noncoding RNA that has been known as precursor microRNA miR-886 (pre-miR-886). Pre-miR-886 has been proposed also as a vault RNA, a component of the vault complex implicated in cancer drug resistance. We identified pre-miR-886 as a 102-nucleotide-long, abundant cytoplasmic RNA that is neither a genuine pre-microRNA nor a vault RNA. Pre-miR-886 is physically associated with PKR (Protein Kinase RNA-activated), an interferon-inducible and double-stranded RNA dependent kinase. The suppression of pre-miR-886 activates PKR and its downstream pathways, eIF2a phosphorylation and the NF-kB pathway, leading to impaired cell proliferation. We also found that pre-miR-886 is suppressed in a wide-range of cancer cell lines and in clinical specimens. This study is the first intense characterization of pre-miR886 as well as the initial report on its function as a PKR regulator, which suggests a critical role in tumorigenesis.},

Widespread exposure to BPA has created a great deal of concern regarding its potential adverse effects on human health. This study examined the relationship between prenatal BPA exposure and birth outcomes, including birth weight, birth length, and ponderal index considering gender difference. A multi-center birth cohort study, Mothers and Children's Environmental Health (MOCEH) has been established in Korea since 2006. Study subjects are 757 pregnant women from the original cohort, who had their urinary BPA level measured during the third trimester, as well as information on birth outcome, prior medical history, psychosocial status, health behavior, environmental exposure as well as socio-demographic characteristics. Regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of BPA on birth outcome. The geometric mean concentration of BPA in pregnant women was 1.29{$\mu$}g/L (1.87{$\mu$}g/g creatinine) during late pregnancy. Urinary BPA concentrations were shown to be higher in women with a higher income level. Univariate regression analysis revealed a significant association between BPA levels and birth weight. In adjusted analysis, the second tertile of maternal BPA exposure exhibited an increase in birth weight, relative to the first tertile (p=0.04). These relationships were more pronounced in male neonates. Also, prenatal exposure to BPA was associated with an increase of ponderal index in total, and especially female neonates. This study shows that the association of prenatal exposure to BPA with anthropometric measures, such as birth weight and birth length, differed by gender. Further study is required to more fully elaborate this relationship between prenatal BPA exposure and birth outcome.},

We replicate previous findings demonstrating a strong correlation between GA and genome-wide DNAm changes. Using substantially more DNAm arrays (n=1,102 in the training set) than a previous study, we present three new placental epigenetic clocks: 1) a robust placental clock (RPC) which is unaffected by common pregnancy complications (e.g., gestational diabetes, preeclampsia), and 2) a control placental clock (CPC) constructed using placental samples from pregnancies without known placental pathology, and 3) a refined RPC for uncomplicated term pregnancies. These placental clocks are highly accurate estimators of GA based on placental tissue; e.g., predicted GA based on RPC is highly correlated with actual GA (r{$>$}0.95 in test data, median error less than one week). We show that epigenetic clocks derived from cord blood or other tissues do not accurately estimate GA in placental samples. While fundamentally different from Horvath's pan-tissue epigenetic clock, placental clocks closely track fetal age during development and may have interesting applications.},

We applied these methods to the summary statistics from an EWAS performed on the methylation data. Comb-p, DMRcate, and GlobalP detected very similar DMRs near the gene CPT1A on chromosome 11 in both the preand posttreatment data. In addition, GlobalP detected 2 DMRs before fenofibrate treatment in the genes ETV6 and ABCG1. Bumphunter identified several DMRs on chromosomes 1 and 20, which did not overlap with DMRs detected by other methods. Conclusions: Our novel method detected the same DMR identified by two existing methods and detected two additional DMRs not identified by any of the existing methods we compared.},

However, the evidence is equivocal, in part due to difficulties in disentangling the effects of mixtures. OBJECTIVES: We assessed associations between multiple correlated biomarkers of environmental exposure and birth weight. METHODS: We evaluated a cohort of 1,250 term ({$\geq$} 37 weeks gestation) singleton infants, born to 513 mothers from Greenland, 180 from Poland, and 557 from Ukraine, who were recruited during antenatal care visits in 2002-2004. Secondary metabolites of diethylhexyl and diisononyl phthalates (DEHP, DiNP), eight perfluoroalkyl acids, and organochlorines (PCB-153 and p,p\textasciiacute -DDE) were quantifiable in 72-100\% of maternal serum samples. We assessed associations between exposures and term birth weight, adjusting for co-exposures and covariates, including prepregnancy body mass index. To identify independent associations, we applied the elastic net penalty to linear regression models. RESULTS: Two phthalate metabolites (MEHHP, MOiNP), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and p,p\textasciiacute -DDE were most consistently predictive of term birth weight based on elastic net penalty regression. In an adjusted, unpenalized regression model of the four exposures, 2-SD increases in natural log\textendash transformed MEHHP, PFOA, and p,p\textasciiacute -DDE were associated with lower birth weight: \textendash 87 g (95\% CI: \textendash 137, \textendash 340 per 1.70 ng/mL), \textendash 43 g (95\% CI: \textendash 108, 23 per 1.18 ng/mL), and \textendash 135 g (95\% CI: \textendash 192, \textendash 78 per 1.82 ng/g lipid), respectively; and MOiNP was associated with higher birth weight (46 g; 95\% CI: \textendash 5, 97 per 2.22 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that several of the environmental contaminants, belonging to three chemical classes, may be independently associated with impaired fetal growth. These results warrant follow-up in other cohorts.},

However, evidence for associations with the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is sparse. We investigated early-life chemical exposures in relation to ADHD. Methods: We used a birth cohort of 2606 Norwegian mother\textendash child pairs enrolled 2002\textendash 2009 (HUMIS), and studied a subset of 1199 pairs oversampled for child neurodevelopmental outcomes. Concentrations of 27 persistent organic pollutants (14 polychlorinated biphenyls, 5 organochlorine pesticides, 6 brominated flame retardants, and 2 perfluoroalkyl substances) were measured in breast milk, reflecting the child's early-life exposures. We estimated postnatal exposures in the first 2 years of life using a pharmacokinetic model. Fifty-five children had a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (hyperkinetic disorder) by 2016, at a median age of 13 years. We used elastic net penalized logistic regression models to identify associations while adjusting for co-exposure confounding, and subsequently used multivariable logistic regression models to obtain effect estimates for the selected exposures. Results: Breast milk concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and {$\beta$}-hexachlorocyclohexane ({$\beta$}-HCH) were associated with increased odds of ADHD: odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 2.72 and OR = 1.75, 95\% CI: 1.22, 2.53, per interquartile range increase in ln-transformed concentrations, respectively. Stronger associations were observed among girls than boys for PFOS (pinteraction = 0.025). p,p{${'}$}-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p{${'}$}-DDT) levels were associated with lower odds of ADHD (OR = 0.64, 95\% CI: 0.42, 0.97). Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) had a non-linear association with ADHD, with increasing risk in the low-level exposure range that switched to a decreasing risk at concentrations above 8 ng/g lipid. Postnatal exposures showed similar results, whereas effect estimates for other chemicals were weaker and imprecise. Conclusions: In a multi-pollutant analysis of four classes of chemicals, early-life exposure to {$\beta$}-HCH and PFOS was associated with increased risk of ADHD, with suggestion of sex-specific effects for PFOS. The unexpected inverse associations between p,p{${'}$}-DDT and higher HCB levels and ADHD could be due to live birth bias; alternatively, results may be due to chance findings.},

  abstract = {The placenta is the principal regulator of the in utero environment, and disruptions to this environment can result in adverse offspring health outcomes. To better characterize the impact of in utero perturbations, we assessed the influence of known environmental pollutants on the expression of microRNA (miRNA) in placental samples collected from the National Children's Study (NCS) Vanguard birth cohort. This study analyzed the expression of 654 miRNAs in 110 term placentas. Environmental pollutants measured in these placentas included dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), bisphenol A (BPA), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd). A moderated t-test was used to identify a panel of differentially expressed miRNAs, which were further analyzed using generalized linear models. We observed 112 miRNAs consistently expressed in {$>$}70\% of the samples. Consistent with the literature, miRNAs located within the imprinted placenta-specific C19MC cluster, specifically mir-517a, mir-517c, mir-522, and mir-23a, are among the top expressed miRNA in our study. We observed a positive association between PBDE 209 and miR-188-5p and an inverse association between PBDE 99 and let-7c. Both PCBs and Cd were positively associated with miR-1537 expression level. In addition, multiple let-7 family members were downregulated with increasing levels of Hg and Pb. We did not observe DDE or BPA levels to be associated with placental miRNA expression. This is the first birth cohort study linking environmental pollutants and placental expression of miRNAs. Our results suggest that placental miRNA profiles may signal in utero exposures to environmental chemicals.},

  abstract = {Correlated multiple testing is widely performed in genetic research, particularly in multilocus analyses of complex diseases. Failure to control appropriately for the effect of multiple testing will either result in a flood of false-positive claims or in true hits being overlooked. Cheverud proposed the idea of adjusting correlated tests as if they were independent, according to an 'effective number' (M(eff)) of independent tests. However, our experience has indicated that Cheverud's estimate of the Meff is overly large and will lead to excessively conservative results. We propose a more accurate estimate of the M(eff), and design M(eff)-based procedures to control the experiment-wise significant level and the false discovery rate. In an evaluation, based on both real and simulated data, the M(eff)-based procedures were able to control the error rate accurately and consequently resulted in a power increase, especially in multilocus analyses. The results confirm that the M(eff) is a useful concept in the error-rate control of correlated tests. With its efficiency and accuracy, the M(eff) method provides an alternative to computationally intensive methods such as the permutation test.},

  abstract = {Cellular immortalization is one of the prerequisite steps in carcinogenesis. By gene expression profiling, we have found that genes in the interferon (IFN) pathway were dysregulated during the spontaneous cellular immortalization of fibroblasts from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients with germ-line mutations in p53. IFN signaling pathway genes were down-regulated by epigenetic silencing during immortalization, and some of these same IFN-regulated genes were activated during replicative senescence. Bisulfite sequencing of the promoter regions of two IFN regulatory transcription factors (IRF5 and IRF7) revealed that IRF7, but not IRF5, was epigenetically silenced by methylation of CpG islands in immortal LFS cells. The induction of IRF7 gene by IFNalpha in immortal LFS cells was potentiated by pretreatment with the demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Overexpression of IRF5 and IRF7 revealed that they can act either alone or in tandem to activate other IFN-regulated genes. In addition, they serve to inhibit the proliferation rate and induce a senescence-related phenotype in immortal LFS cells. Furthermore, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid treatment of the IRF-overexpressing cells showed a more rapid induction of several IFN-regulated genes. We conclude that the epigenetic inactivation of the IFN pathway plays a critical role in cellular immortalization, and the reactivation of IFN-regulated genes by transcription factors IRF5 and/or IRF7 is sufficient to induce cellular senescence. The IFN pathway may provide valuable molecular targets for therapeutic interventions at early stages of cancer development.},

  abstract = {Defective IFN signaling results in loss of innate immunity and sensitizes cells to enhanced cytolytic killing after Vesticular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) infection. Examination of the innate immunity status of normal human bronchial epithelial cells Beas2B and 7 lung cancer cells revealed that the abrogation of IFN signaling in cancer cells is associated with greater sensitivity to VSV infection. The disruption of the IFN pathway in lung cancer cell lines and primary tumor tissues is caused by epigenetic silencing of critical interferon responsive transcription factors IRF7 and/or IRF5. Although 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment fails to reactivate IRF7 and IRF5 expression or protect cells from VSV infection, manipulating IFN signaling by altering IRF expression changes the viral susceptibility of these cells. Lung cancer cells can be partially protected from viral killing using IRF5+IRF7 overexpression, whereas IFN pathway disruption by transfection of siRNAs to IRF5+IRF7 increases cells' vulnerability to viral infection. Therefore, IRF5 and IRF7 are key transcription factors in IFN pathway that determine viral sensitivity of lung cancer cells; the epigenetically impaired IFN pathway in lung cancer tissues provides potential biomarkers for successful selective killing of cancer cells by oncolytic viral therapy.},

  abstract = {Background: DNA methylation offers an excellent example for elucidating how epigenetic information affects gene expression. {$\beta$} values and M values are commonly used to quantify DNA methylation. Statistical methods applicable to DNA methylation data analysis span a number of approaches such as Wilcoxon rank sum test, t-test, Kolmogorov\textendash Smirnov test, permutation test, empirical Bayes method, and bump hunting method. Nonetheless, selection of an optimal statistical method can be challenging when different methods generate inconsistent results from the same data set. Results: We compared six statistical approaches relevant to DNA methylation microarray analysis in terms of false discovery rate control, statistical power, and stability through simulation studies and real data examples. Observable differences were noticed between {$\beta$} values and M values only when methylation levels were correlated across CpG loci. For small sample size (n =3 or 6 in each group), both the empirical Bayes and bump hunting methods showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG loci were independent. Only the bump hunting method showed appropriate FDR control and the highest power when methylation levels across CpG sites were correlated. For medium (n=12 in each group) and large sample sizes (n=24 in each group), all methods compared had similar power, except for the permutation test whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was low. For all sample sizes, the bump hunting method had the lowest stability in terms of standard deviation of total discoveries whenever the proportion of differentially methylated loci was large. The apparent test power comparisons based on raw p-values from DNA methylation studies on ovarian cancer and rheumatoid arthritis provided results as consistent as those obtained in the simulation studies. Overall, these results provide guidance for optimal statistical methods selection under different scenarios. Conclusions: For DNA methylation studies with small sample size, the bump hunting method and the empirical Bayes method are recommended when DNA methylation levels across CpG loci are independent, while only the bump hunting method is recommended when DNA methylation levels are correlated across CpG loci. All methods are acceptable for medium or large sample sizes.},

  abstract = {The present study was planned to explore the correlation between the methylation of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and colon carcinogenesis. Colon cancer tissues and tumor-adjacent normal tissues of 60 colon cancer patients (who received surgical operation in our hospital from January 2012 to December 2014) were collected. SW1116 cells in human colon cancer tissues were selected for culturing. 5-aza-2c-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) was utilized as an inhibitor of the methylation for APC gene. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) was utilized for detection of APC methylation in SW1116 cells. The MTT and Transwell assays were performed to detect the effect of the methylation of APC gene on the proliferation and invasive abilities of SW1116 cells. The correlation between the methylation of APC gene and pathological parameters of colon cancer patients was analyzed. MSP results revealed that 41 cases (68.33\%) showed methylation of APC gene in colon cancer tissues. No methylation of APC gene was found in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. 5-aza-dC was able to inhibit the methylation of APC gene in SW1116 cells. APC gene methylation was correlated with tumor size, differentiation degree, lymph node metastasis and Dukes staging. In conclusion, the levels of the methylation of APC in colon cancer tissues and SW1116 cells are relatively high. The methylation of APC promoted the proliferation and invasion abilities of SW1116 cells. Furthermore, methylation is correlated with a variety of clinicopathological features of colon cancer patients.},

To reveal the impact and the underlying mechanism of BPA on the crosstalk between trophoblast and decidual stromal cells (DSCs), we determined whether BPA was able to affect trophoblast invasion in~vitro. We found that BPA significantly inhibited CXCL8 expression in DSCs, which hindered trophoblast invasion, and activated the phosphorylation of ERK in DSCs. U0126, an inhibitor of ERK activation, remarkably rescued trophoblast invasion and the inhibition of CXCL8 expression caused by BPA treatment. Moreover, the nuclear estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 and transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 (membrane estrogen receptor) antagonist G15 significantly blocked the phosphorylation of ERK and reversed the reduction of trophoblast invasion. In brief, BPA activated ERK through nuclear and membrane estrogen receptors and inhibited CXCL8 expression in DSCs, thereby affecting their regulation of trophoblast invasion.},

Tanshinone IIA (TIIA), a diterpene quinone phytochemical, has been shown to possess powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, epigenetics, and protective effects against different diseases including DN by inhibiting ROS induced by high glucose (HG). However, epigenomic and transcriptomic study of DN and the protective effect of TIIA are lacking. In this study, next-generation sequencing of RNA and DNA methylation profiles on the potential underlying mechanisms of a DN model in mouse kidney mesangial mes13 cells challenged with HG and treatment with TIIA were conducted. Bioinformatic analysis coupled with Ingenuity Pathway analysis of RNA-seq was performed, and 1780 genes from HG/LG and 1416 genes from TIIA/HG were significantly altered. Several pro-inflammatory pathways like leukotriene biosynthesis and eicosanoid signaling pathways were activated by HG stimulation, while TIIA treatment would enhance glutathione-mediated detoxification pathway to overcome the excess oxidative stress and inflammation triggered by HG. Combination analysis of RNA-seq and Methyl-seq data sets, DNA methylation, and RNA expression of a list of DN associated genes, Nmu, Fgl2, Glo, and Kcnip2, were found to be altered in HG-induced mes13 DN model, and TIIA treatment would effectively restore the alterations. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the understanding of how epigenetic/epigenomic modifications could affect the progression of DN and the potential preventive effect of TIIA in DN.},

In addition, whether fetal thyroid hormones (THs) mediate the reported association remains unclear. The present study aimed to examine the association between prenatal BPA exposure and risks of child behavioral problems at 2 and 4~years of age and whether the association could be explained by alteration of fetal THs as measured in cord plasma. Using the Shanghai-Minhang Birth Cohort Study (S-MBCS), BPA concentration was measured in maternal urine samples collected at 12\textendash 16~weeks of gestation. Children's neurobehavioral development was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5\textendash 5 (CBCL), at 2 and 4~years of age. Using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, 745 mother-pairs were included to examine associations of BPA with CBCL scores, Using multiple linear regression models, 348 mother-pairs were included to evaluate the association between maternal BPA and THs in cord plasma. A mediation analysis was conducted to explore the potential mediating role of THs. After adjusting for potential confounders, prenatal BPA level was associated with increased risks of Emotionally Reactive problem, Anxious/Depressed problem, having Somatic Complaints, exhibiting Aggressive Behavior, and Internalizing and Externalizing Problems: compared to the lowest tertile, the risks in the highest tertile and middle tertile, ranged between 1.55-fold (95\% CI: 1.09, 2.21) and 2.59-fold (95\% CI: 1.52, 4.42). The association was more pronounced among boys. None of the associations reached statistical significance among girls. An inverse association between prenatal BPA and fetal TH level was also observed. However, the observed neurotoxic effects of prenatal BPA exposure did not appear to be mediated by THs levels. The current findings suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA may disrupt fetal THs levels and may induce long-lasting behavioral alterations, especially in boys.},

  abstract = {Background As one of the most common genitourinary malignancies worldwide, bladder cancer affects about 3.4 million people globally, with 430,000 new cases a year since 2015. Despite the advances in bladder cancer diagnosis and therapy, there has been little progress in the patients' overall survival in nearly 30 years. Therefore, investigating novel molecular therapeutic targets is required to gain insight into the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer, which ultimately may be used to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. Methods Herein, we used gene knockdown in vitro and in vivo to unveil the unknown roles of ZSCAN16 in bladder cancer. Afterward, to decipher the unknown regulatory role of ZSCAN16 in tumor progression, we verified that a bunch of genes including NF-{$\kappa$}B, AKT, mTOR, and P38 were the key downstream regulators of ZSCAN16 by western blot and rescue experiments. Results We found high expression of ZSCAN16 transcripts in bladder cancer cells and tumor samples from the TCGA database and tissue microarray bank, demonstrated in correlation with poor prognosis for bladder cancer patients. The in vitro experiments indicated that the silencing of ZSCAN16 by shRNA lentivirus promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation, colony formation, as well as migration and invasion in T24 cells. By investigating the signaling pathways, we proved ZSCAN16 play a novel role as oncogenic gene in bladder cancer by regulating NF-{$\kappa$}B, AKT, mTOR, P38 and other genes. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments identified that ZSCAN16 knockdown retarded the tumor growth in nude mice. Conclusions In summary, these findings revealed that ZSCAN16 is a potential novel oncogene in the development and progression of bladder cancer. This study will shed light on developing novel therapeutic targets in the future treatment of bladder cancer.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have shown an association between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse effects on neurodevelopment and behavior in young children. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the relationship between prenatal exposure to phthalate esters and behavior syndromes in children at 8 years of age. METHODS: A total of 122 mother-child pairs from the general population in central Taiwan were studied from 2000 to 2009. Mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), and three di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites-mono-2-ethylhexyl, mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl, and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalates (MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP)--were measured in maternal urine collected during the third trimester of pregnancy using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Behavioral syndromes of children at 8 years of age were evaluated using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Associations between log10-transformed creatinine-corrected phthalate concentrations and standardized scores of the CBCL were estimated using linear regression models or multinomial logistic regressions with adjustments for potential confounders. RESULTS: Externalizing problem scores were significantly higher in association with a 1-unit increase in log10-transformed creatinine-corrected concentrations of maternal MBP ({$\beta$} = 4.29; 95\% CI: 0.59, 7.99), MEOHP ({$\beta$} = 3.74; 95\% CI: 1.33, 6.15), and MEHP ({$\beta$} = 4.28 ; 95\% CI: 0.03, 8.26) after adjusting for the child's sex, intelligence, and family income. Meanwhile, MBP and MEOHP were significantly associated with Delinquent Behavior and Aggressive Behavior scores. The same pattern was found for borderline and/or clinical ranges. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest positive associations between maternal DEHP and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure and externalizing domain behavior problems in 8-year-old children.},

This study aimed to evaluate the association between in utero exposure to four PFASs and the development of neurobehavioral symptoms related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in early childhood. Methods: Eligible study subjects were selected from the Taiwan Birth Panel Study and the Taiwan EarlyLife Cohort, which enrolled a total of 1526 mother-infant pairs during 2004 and 2005. We collected umbilical cord blood and analyzed perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanyl sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) levels. When a child was 7 years old, to evaluate ADHD related neurobehavioral symptoms, their parents completed the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham IV scale (SNAP-IV), the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) questionnaires. We used linear regression models with inverse probability weighting to explore the association between prenatal exposure to four PFASs and ADHD rating scores. Results: A total of 282 subjects have completed the PFASs analysis and questionnaire survey. After adjusted for potential confounders, we observed that PFNA is inversely associated with inattention and oppositional defiant disorder of SNAP-IV, and hyperactivity/inattention of SDQ. No association between PFOA, PFOS, or PFUA and ADHD symptoms was found. Conclusions: Prenatal exposure to PFNA was found to associate with neurobehavioral symptoms related to ADHD among Asian seven-year-old children. Further studies are needed to elucidate the causal relationship.},

Positive correlations between PFASs and neurobehavioral problems in children were reported in cross-sectional data, but findings from prospective studies are limited. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether prenatal exposure to PFASs is associated with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or childhood autism in children. METHODS: Among 83,389 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1996-2002, we identified 890 ADHD cases and 301 childhood autism cases from the Danish National Hospital Registry and the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry. From this cohort, we randomly selected 220 cases each of ADHD and autism, and we also randomly selected 550 controls frequency matched by child's sex. Sixteen PFASs were measured in maternal plasma collected in early or mid-pregnancy. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) using generalized linear models, taking into account sampling weights. RESULTS: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were detected in all samples; four other PFASs were quantified in {$\geq$} 90\% of the samples. We did not find consistent evidence of associations between mother's PFAS plasma levels and ADHD [per natural log nanograms per milliliter increase: PFOS RR = 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.74, 1.02); PFOA RR = 0.98 (95\% CI: 0.82, 1.16)] or autism [per natural log nanograms per milliliter increase: PFOS RR = 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.69, 1.22); PFOA RR = 0.98 (95\% CI: 0.73, 1.31)]. We found positive as well as negative associations between higher PFAS quartiles and ADHD in models that simultaneously adjusted for all PFASs, but these estimates were imprecise. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found no consistent evidence to suggest that prenatal PFAS exposure increases the risk of ADHD or childhood autism in children.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate whether prenatal exposure to PFASs is associated with IQ in children. METHODS: We studied 1,592 pregnancies enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) during 1996\textendash 2002. Sixteen PFASs were measured in maternal plasma collected in early gestation. Child IQ was assessed at 5 y of age using the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence\textendash Revised (WPPSI-R) administered by trained psychologists. Using multivariable linear regression models, we estimated the differences in child IQ scores according to PFAS concentration [per natural-log (ng/mL) unit increase or values categorized in quartiles]. RESULTS: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were detected in all samples, and five additional PFASs were quantified in {$>$}80\% of the samples. Overall, we found no strong associations between a natural-log unit increase in each of the seven PFASs we evaluated and child IQ scores. A few positive and negative associations were found in the sex-stratified PFAS quartile analyses, but the patterns were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Overall, we did not find consistent evidence to suggest prenatal exposure to PFASs to be associated with child IQ scores at 5 y of age in the DNBC. Some of the sex-specific observations warrant further investigation. Additional studies should examine offspring IQ at older ages and assess other functional cognitive and neuropsychiatric measures in addition to intelligence. Postnatal exposures to PFASs and mixture effects for PFASs and PFASs with other environmental pollutants should also be considered in future research. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2754},

Rodent studies suggest that prenatal and postnatal neurodevelopmental toxicity from BPA exposure may manifest as social deficits in offspring. We investigated the association between prenatal and postnatal exposure to BPA and social impairments in a sample of 4-year-old children. METHODS: We recruited second-trimester pregnant women between 2008 and 2011, and measured their creatinine-adjusted prenatal urine BPA levels. In 2014-2015, a subset of 4-year-old children born to these women underwent neurobehavioral assessment and physical examination. We collected urine and blood from the children and assessed social impairments, including deficits in social interaction, social communication, and other behavior patterns using the Korean version of the Social Communication Questionnaire (K-SCQ) (n~=~304). We examined social impairments associated with prenatal exposure at mid-term pregnancy and postnatal exposure to BPA at 4~years of age, using linear and piecewise linear regression models. RESULTS: The relationship between prenatal BPA exposure and social communication was non-linear and statistically significant at or above the flexion point for BPA levels of 3.0~{$\mu$}g/g creatinine in girls (58.4\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI], 6.5\% to 135.8\%). Each 2-fold increase in postnatal BPA exposure was significantly associated with an 11.8\% (95\% CI, 0.6\% to 24.3\%) increase in impairment in social communication in 4-year old girls, as indicated by the linear regression model. CONCLUSION: Prenatal and postnatal BPA exposure is associated with social impairment at 4~years of age, particularly in girls.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting is a process causing genes to be expressed according to parental origin. Imprinting acts to coordinate fetal and prenatal growth, as well as control postnatal adaptations. Studies on human imprinting are confounded by tissue availability, sampling variability and limitations posed by tissue-specific expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues. The human umbilical cord is an easily available, embryonic-derived fetal tissue with the potential to overcome many of these limitations. METHODS: In a sensitive, gene-specific quantitative expression analysis, we show for the first time robust imprinted gene expression combined with methylation analysis in cords isolated from Asian Chinese full-term births. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses revealed an inverse correlation between expression of pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 2 (PHLDA2) with birth weight (BW). Furthermore, we observed significant down-regulation of the paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) in low BW babies compared to optimum BW babies. This change in PEG10 gene expression was accompanied by concomitant methylation alterations at the PEG10 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to demonstrate relative expression of an imprinted gene associated with epigenetic changes in non-syndromic fetal growth restriction in babies. They show that perturbed expression in compromised fetal growth may be associated with in utero modulation of the epigenetic state at the imprinting control regions and implicate specific imprinted genes as new biomarkers of fetal growth.},

During pregnancy, the placenta undergoes many structural and functional changes in response to fetal needs and environmental exposures. Previous studies have demonstrated widespread epigenetic and gene expression changes from early to late pregnancy. However, on the global level, how DNA methylation changes impact on gene expression in human placenta is not yet well understood. We performed DNA methylome analysis by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and gene expression analysis by RNA-Seq for both first and third trimester human placenta tissues. From first to third trimester, 199 promoters (corresponding to 189 genes) and 2,297 gene bodies were differentially methylated, with a clear dominance of hypermethylation (96.8\% and 93.0\% for promoters and gene bodies, respectively). A total of 2,447 genes were differentially expressed, of which 77.2\% were down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis using differentially expressed genes were enriched for cell cycle and immune response functions. The correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression was non-linear and complex, depending on the genomic context (promoter or gene body) and gene expression levels. A wide range of DNA methylation and gene expression changes were observed at different gestational ages. The non-linear association between DNA methylation and gene expression indicates that epigenetic regulation of placenta development is more complex than previously envisioned.},

  abstract = {Background: Illumina's HumanMethylation450 arrays provide the most cost-effective means of high-throughput DNA methylation analysis. As with other types of microarray platforms, technical artifacts are a concern, including background fluorescence, dye-bias from the use of two color channels, bias caused by type I/II probe design, and batch effects. Several approaches and pipelines have been developed, either targeting a single issue or designed to address multiple biases through a combination of methods. We evaluate the effect of combining separate approaches to improve signal processing. Results: In this study nine processing methods, including both within- and between- array methods, are applied and compared in four datasets. For technical replicates, we found both within- and between-array methods did a comparable job in reducing variance across replicates. For evaluating biological differences, within-array processing always improved differential DNA methylation signal detection over no processing, and always benefitted from performing background correction first. Combinations of within-array procedures were always among the best performing methods, with a slight advantage appearing for the between-array method Funnorm when batch effects explained more variation in the data than the methylation alterations between cases and controls. However, when this occurred, RUVm, a new batch correction method noticeably improved reproducibility of differential methylation results over any of the signal-processing methods alone. Conclusions: The comparisons in our study provide valuable insights in preprocessing HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data. We found the within-array combination of Noob + BMIQ always improved signal sensitivity, and when combined with the RUVm batch-correction method, outperformed all other approaches in performing differential DNA methylation analysis. The effect of the data processing method, in any given data set, was a function of both the signal and noise.},

We aim to examine whether pregnancy maternal acetaminophen use increases the risk for offspring asthma, and whether such a potential association could be modified by maternal coffee consumption. Methods We included 63 652 live-born singletons enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort. Maternal acetaminophen use and coffee consumption during pregnancy were assessed prospectively via the enrolment questionnaire and three computer-assisted telephone interviews. Asthma cases were identified by using the Danish National Patient Register and the Danish National Prescription Registry. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) for asthma according to prenatal acetaminophen and coffee exposure using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of offspring asthma (HR = 1.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.11\textendash 1.22). Coffee drinking during pregnancy was associated with a slightly decreased risk (HR = 0.94, 95\%CI: 0.90\textendash 0.99). But there was no strong evidence of effect measure modification of acetaminophen use on offspring asthma by coffee consumption. Conclusions Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with a modest increased risk for offspring asthma, which was not modified by coffee consumption.

However, how the human trophoblast lineage is regulated, including the categorization of the placental cell subtypes is poorly understood.

New subtypes of cells of the known cytotrophoblast cells (CTBs), extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs), Hofbauer cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells were identified and cell-type-specific gene signatures were defined. Functionally, this study revealed many previously unknown functions of the human placenta. Notably, 102 polypeptide hormone genes were found to be expressed by various subtypes of placental cells, which suggests a complex and significant role of these hormones in regulating fetal growth and adaptations of maternal physiology to pregnancy.

The IUGR group consisted of 19 fetuses from pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and 16 from healthy mothers. Color Doppler evaluation of umbilical, spiral and uterine arteries was performed. Placental specimens from both normal and growth-retarded fetuses were obtained at the time of delivery. Placental specimens were evaluated using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. A progressive decrease in the pulsatility index was observed in umbilical, spiral and uterine arteries throughout pregnancy in the normal-growth fetuses. High umbilical artery pulsatility index values were obtained in 29 out of the 35 growth-retarded fetuses, six of them showing absent or reversed end-diastolic umbilical artery flow pattern. A total of 13 IUGR fetuses showed high resistance uterine artery flow velocity waveforms. Increased pulsatility index values were obtained from the spiral arteries of 16 growth-retarded fetuses. Abnormal histological and histochemical placental patterns were observed in all the growth-retarded fetuses with umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities. The presence of a peculiar dendritic cell subpopulation, strongly resembling the Langerhans cells, expressing the HLA-DR+/CD1+ phenotype, was detected in all growth-retarded fetuses, whether there was maternal pathology or not. Our data show uterine and spiral artery data as being ineffective in the monitoring of IUGR fetuses. The placental extracellular matrix seems to play an important role in the regulation of the umbilical circulation. The presence of CD1+ cells as a sign of a possible immunological mechanism in the pathogenesis of the intrauterine growth retardation is discussed.},

There is limited to no information on the link between PA during pregnancy and the molecular mechanisms governing placental function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which maternal PA may influence placental function. Methods The level of PA was measured by accelerometry and gene expression was measured in term placenta with custom polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays and microarray analysis followed by a pathway analyses on significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Results Microarray analysis showed 43 significantly DEGs between active and non-active participants. RT-qPCR validation of a sub-sample of DEGs revealed significant changes in the level of expression between active and non-active moms (student's t-test, p~{$<~$}0.05, n~=~11). Genes involved in transport of water (p~=~0.00236) and uptake of glycerol (p~=~0.00219) were enriched in active moms. PA was also associated with the alteration of alternative splicing patters. The most consistent splicing changes were observed for AQP9 where active moms lacked exon 2. Discussion Variations in maternal PA influences placental gene. We show significant expression changes of genes that are involved in transport and localization between active and non-active women. Most notably, the expression of the aquaporin family of genes (e.g. AQP1 and AQP9) were found to be significantly higher in the placentas of active women suggesting an adaptive response for the transport of water and glycerol in this population.},

A vast number of tissue-specific differentially methylated regions are identified and considered likely mediators of tissue-specific gene regulatory mechanisms since the hypomethylated regions are closely related to known functions of the corresponding tissue. Finally, a clear inverse correlation is observed between promoter methylation within CpG islands and gene expression data obtained from publicly available databases. Conclusions This genome-wide methylation profiling study identified tissue-specific differentially methylated regions in 17 human somatic tissues. Many of the genes corresponding to these differentially methylated regions contribute to tissue-specific functions. Future studies may use these data as a reference to identify markers of perturbed differentiation and disease-related pathogenic mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Background: Evidence has indicated that some non-inherited factors such as exposure to environmental pollutants are associated with neurodevelopment disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies report that endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and some metals, have adverse effects on the fetal neurodevelopment. The aim of this study was to measure the amniotic fluid (AF) levels of EDCs and metals as well as the receptor transactivities induced by AF and investigate the possible link between prenatal exposure to EDCs and heavy metals and ASD risk. Methods: In this case-control study, we included AF samples of 75 ASD cases and 135 frequency-matched controls and measured the levels of the endogenous sex hormones, PFAS, and elements including heavy metals. The combined effect of endogenous hormones and EDCs on the receptor of estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), aryl hydrocarbon (AhR), and thyroid hormone-like activity were also determined and expressed as receptor ligand equivalents. We assessed the associations of AF levels of chemicals, sex hormones, and receptor activities with ASD risk using unconditional logistical regression analyses. To control for multiple comparisons, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used and q values less than 0.25 were designated as statistical significance. Results: PFAS and metals were detectable in AF samples. The ASD cases had significantly lower AF levels of PFAS than controls, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.410 (95\% CI 0.174, 0.967; p\,=\,0.042; FDR qvalue\,=\,0.437) for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The principal component, including PFAS congeners, copper, iron, and estrogenic activity, was significantly inversely associated with ASD risk (adjusted OR\,=\,0.100; 95\% CI 0.016, 0.630; p\,=\,0.014; FDR qvalue\,=\,0.098).Testosterone level in AF weakly associated with ASD risk (adjusted OR\,=\,1.002; 95\% CI 1.000, 1.004; p\,=\,0.05). However, after multiple comparison correction, the association was not significant (FDR qvalue\,=\,0.437). No significant associations between AF-induced receptor transactivities and ASD risk were observed. The adjusted OR was 2.176 (95\%CI 0.115, 41.153) for the ratio of the combined androgenic activity to combined estrogenic activity. Conclusions: The presence of PFAS and heavy metals in AF indicates that they can cross the placenta. The inverse association between levels of PFAS congeners in AF and ASD risk might relate to the weak estrogenic activities and anti-androgenic activities of PFAS.The observed tendency of positive association between the ratio of combined androgenic effect to the combined estrogenic effect and ASD risk needs further studies to explore whether EDCs together with endogenous hormones play a role in the development of ASD.},

  abstract = {DNA hypermethylation has emerged as a molecular biomarker for the evaluation of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We define a methylation signature of bladder cancer and evaluate whether this profile assesses prognosis of patients. Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed on 70 tumor and 10 normal bladder samples. Hypermethylation status of 1505 CpGs present in the promoter region of 807 genes was studied. Thirty-three genes were significantly hypermethylated in {$\geq$}10\% of the tumors. Three clusters of patients were characterized by their DNA methylation profile, one at higher risk of dead of disease (p = 0.0012). Association between cluster distribution and stage (p = 0.02) or grade (p = 0.02) was demonstrated. Hypermethylation of JAK3 and absence of hypermethylation of EYA4, GAT6, and SOX1 were associated with low-grade non-invasive disease. On the other hand, in high-grade invasive disease hypermethylation of CSPG2, HOXA11, HOXA9, HS3ST2, SOX1, and TWIST1 was associated with muscle invasiveness. A panel of hypermethylated genes including APC, CSPG2, EPHA5, EYA4, HOXA9, IPF1, ISL1, JAK3, PITX2, SOX1, and TWIST1 predicted cancer-specific survival and SOX1 (HR = 3.46), PITX2 (HR = 4.17), CSPG2 (HR = 5.35), and JAK3 hypermethylation (HR = 0.19) did so independently. Silencing of genes by hypermethylation is a common event in bladder cancer and could be used to develop diagnostic and prognostic markers. Combined hypermethylation of SOX1, PITX2, or CSPG2 signals patients at higher risk of death from bladder cancer.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the current standard therapy for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), many neonates have contraindications to receiving or may fail NSAID therapy. To avoid surgical ligation, these patients may benefit from an alternative therapy. The objective of this research is to report the efficacy and safety of acetaminophen for the treatment of PDA in a cohort of premature neonates. METHODS Demographics and clinical course were retrospectively evaluated for all neonates admitted during the study period who received acetaminophen for the treatment of PDA. Initial acetaminophen dosing was 15 mg/kg every 6 hours (88\% intravenous). Efficacy was analyzed from ductal constriction on echocardiogram as well as need for further PDA treatment. Markers of hepatic and renal function as well as respiratory support and neonatal morbidities were evaluated to describe the safety of acetaminophen. RESULTS Forty-one neonates were identified with a median birth weight of 760 g (IQR 614\textendash{} 948 g) and median gestational age of 25 weeks (IQR 24\textendash 27 weeks). Treatment was initiated at a median postnatal age of 15 days (IQR 8\textendash 19 days) for a median duration of 7 days (IQR 6\textendash 10 days). Twenty-seven neonates (66\%) required no further PDA treatment, with echocardiographic PDA closure documented in 10 neonates (24\%) and reduced ductal size in 15 neonates (37\%). No clinically significant adverse effects attributable to acetaminophen therapy were detected. CONCLUSIONS Most patients in this study responded to acetaminophen treatment for PDA, indicating that this therapy may be an option for extremely low-birth-weight neonates in order to avoid surgical ligation.},

To investigate the effects of AQP1 gene knockout on expression of other aquaporin water channels (AQP3, AQP8 and AQP9) in placentas and fetal membranes. METHODS: Mice were sacrificed at 9.5, 13.5 and 16.5 gestational day (GD). Amniotic fluid volume, osmolality and composition, fetal membranes, placental and fetal weights as well as placenta areas were recorded in Aqp1 homozygote conceptus group, heterozygote conceptus group and wild-type group, respectively. The expression of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and AQP9 mRNA and protein in placenta and fetal membranes were examined by quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting. RESULTS: Aqp1 homozygote conceptus had a greater volume of amniotic fluid, lower osmolality and calcium concentration than their wild-type counterparts at 16.5 GD. There was no significant difference in expression of AQP1, AQP3, AQP8 and AQP9 in placentas among three groups. While expression of AQP8 was increased at 13.5 and 16.5 GD in fetal membranes, the expression of AQP9 was significantly decreased in fetal membranes in Aqp1 homozygote group compared with Aqp1 heterozygote and wild-type groups. CONCLUSION: AQP1 may play an important role in the homeostasis of maternal-fetal fluid at late gestation days. The mechanism of mutual compensation among AQPs gene needs further investigation.},

The expression and location of AQP1 and other AQPs in the placenta and foetal membranes of AQP1-/- mice, AQP1-siRNA transfected WISH cells and oligohydramnios patients were also detected. Compared to control mice, AQP1-/- mice exhibited reduced copulation plug and successful pregnancy rates, but these effects were accompanied by a larger AF volume and lower AF osmolality at late gestation. AQP9 expression was significantly decreased in the placenta and foetal membranes of AQP1-/- mice, while AQP8 level was elevated in the foetal membranes of AQP1-/- mice. Moreover, AQP9 expression was suppressed in WISH cells after AQP1 downregulation. Furthermore, AQP9 expression was associated with AQP1 level in the placenta and foetal membranes in oligohydramnios. AQP1 may play a critical role in regulating pregnancy outcome and maternal-foetal fluid homeostasis. Changes in AQP1 expression may lead to compensatory alterations in AQP8 and AQP9 expression in the placenta.},

Effects of early-life exposure to atmospheric pollutants were reported, based on outdoor air pollution levels. For both exposure families, exposure misclassification is expected from these designs: for non-persistent chemicals, because a spot biospecimen is unlikely to capture exposure over windows longer than a few days; for air pollutants, because indoor levels are ignored. We developed a couple-child cohort relying on deep phenotyping and extended personal exposure assessment aiming to better characterize the effects of components of the exposome, including air pollutants and non-persistent endocrine disruptors, on child health and development. Pregnant women were included in SEPAGES couple-child cohort (Grenoble area) from 2014 to 2017. Maternal and children exposure to air pollutants was repeatedly assessed by personal monitors. DNA, RNA, serum, plasma, placenta, cord blood, meconium, child and mother stools, living cells, milk, hair and repeated urine samples were collected. A total of 484 pregnant women were recruited, with excellent compliance to the repeated urine sampling protocol (median, 43 urine samples per woman during pregnancy). The main health outcomes are child respiratory health using early objective measures, growth and neurodevelopment. Compared to former studies, the accuracy of assessment of non-persistent exposures is expected to be strongly improved in this new type of birth cohort tailored for the exposome concept, with deep phenotyping and extended exposure characterization. By targeting weaknesses in exposure assessment of the current approaches of cohorts on effects of early life environmental exposures with strong temporal variations, and relying on a rich biobank to provide insight on the underlying biological pathways whereby exposures affect health, this design is expected to provide deeper understanding of the interplay between the Exposome and child development and health.},

TCS is associated with the development of liver tumors in rodents and has become a concern to environmental and human health. This study is aimed at investigating whether TCS could modulate the levels of global DNA methylation (GDM) in human hepatocytes. We found that treatment with different doses (1.25\textendash 10{$\mu$}M) of TCS did not affect HepG2 cell viability, but significantly reduced the levels of GDM in HepG2 cells, and inhibited DNMT1 activity. Furthermore, treatment with TCS significantly inhibited the methylated DNA-binding domain 2 (MBD2), MBD3, and MeCP2 mRNA transcription. In addition, treatment with TCS promoted the accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in a dose-dependent manner, which was abrogated by treatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Collectively, our data indicated that TCS reduced the levels of GDM and down-regulated the MBD2, MBD3, and MeCP2 gene expression by increasing 8-OHdG levels and inhibiting the DNMT1 activity in HepG2 cells.},

  abstract = {Neural networks were widely used for quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in the 1990s. Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck's drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.},

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal mercury (Hg) exposure is associated with adverse child neurobehavioral outcomes. Because Hg can interfere with placental functioning and cross the placenta to target the fetal brain, prenatal Hg exposure can inhibit fetal growth and development directly and indirectly. Objectives: We examined potential associations between prenatal Hg exposure assessed through infant toenail Hg, placental DNA methylation changes, and newborn neurobehavioral outcomes. Methods: The methylation status of {$>$} 485,000 CpG loci was interrogated in 192 placental samples using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadArray. Hg concentrations were analyzed in toenail clippings from a subset of 41 infants; neurobehavior was assessed using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) in an independent subset of 151 infants. Results: We identified 339 loci with an average methylation difference {$>$} 0.125 between any two toenail Hg tertiles. Variation among these loci was subsequently found to be associated with a highrisk neurodevelopmental profile (omnibus p-value = 0.007) characterized by the NNNS. Ten loci had p {$<$} 0.01 for the association between methylation and the high-risk NNNS profile. Six of 10 loci reside in the EMID2 gene and were hypomethylated in the 16 high-risk profile infants' placentas. Methylation at these loci was moderately correlated (correlation coefficients range, \textendash 0.33 to \textendash 0.45) with EMID2 expression. Conclusions: EMID2 hypomethylation may represent a novel mechanism linking in utero Hg exposure and adverse infant neurobehavioral outcomes.

  abstract = {The developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis states that adverse early life exposures can have lasting, detrimental effects on lifelong health. Exposure to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with morbidity and mortality in offspring, including increased risks for miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, preterm birth, asthma, obesity, altered neurobehavior, and other conditions. Maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy interferes with placental growth and functioning, and it has been proposed that this may occur through the disruption of normal and necessary placental epigenetic patterns. Epigenome-wide association studies have identified a number of differentially methylated placental genes that are associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy, including RUNX3, PURA, GTF2H2, GCA, GPR135, and HKR1. The placental methylation status of RUNX3 and NR3C1 has also been linked to adverse infant outcomes, including preterm birth and low birth weight, respectively. Candidate gene analyses have also found maternal smoking-associated placental methylation differences in the NR3C1, CYP1A1, HTR2A, and HSD11B2 genes, as well as in the repetitive elements LINE-1 and AluYb8. The differential methylation patterns of several genes have been confirmed to also exhibit altered gene expression patterns, including CYP1A1, CYP19A1, NR3C1, and HTR2A. Placental methylation patterns associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy may be largely gene-specific and tissue-specific and, to a lesser degree, involve global changes. It is important for future research to investigate the mechanistic roles that these differentially methylated genes may play in mediating the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and disease in later life, as well as to elucidate the potential influence of emerging tobacco product use during pregnancy, including the use of electronic cigarettes, on placental epigenetics.},

Among various epigenetic regulators of gene expression, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important players that may also be involved in the manifestation of endocrine-disrupting chemical toxicity. We sought to explore the association between maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and lncRNA expression in human placenta to better understand potential mechanisms through which lncRNAs participate in mediating phthalate toxicity. Ten patients with uncomplicated dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies at term were included in this study. Urinary (n = 10) and placenta samples (n = 20) were collected for all participants. Urinary samples were analyzed for 15 phthalate metabolites and 2 phthalate alternative metabolites. Real-time PCR arrays were used to identify and quantify 87 lncRNAs from the placental samples. We tested the Spearman correlation matrix to compare prenatal phthalate measures against placental lncRNA levels. lncRNA levels showed large variations across samples, with no significant differences in lncRNA expression within twin pairs. Mono-(carboxynonyl) phthalate demonstrated consistently strong correlations with most lncRNAs. The strongest correlation was observed between mono-hydroxyisobutyl phthalate and LOC91450 (Rspearman = 0.88, p {$<$} .001). This correlation remained significant after Bonferroni adjustment. Other strong correlations were observed between mono-isobutyl phthalate, DPP10 and HOTTIP (Rspearman = -0.91, p {$<$} .001). AIRN, DACT3.AS1, DLX6, DPP10, HOTTIP, LOC143666, and LOC91450 were strongly correlated with the greatest number of phthalate metabolites. Further studies are needed to validate these results and understand if the altered expression of lncRNAs in human placenta has clinical significance.},

The relative importance of prenatal vs infant exposure and confounding by indication remains elusive. We examined the association of prenatal and infant (first 6 months) paracetamol exposure with asthma development while addressing confounding by indication. ,  Methods: We used information from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 53169 children for evaluation of current asthma at 3 years, 25394 for current asthma at 7 years and 45607 for dispensed asthma medications at 7 years in the Norwegian Prescription Database. We calculated adjusted relative risks (adj. RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) using log-binomial regression. ,  Results: There were independent modest associations between asthma at 3 years with prenatal paracetamol exposure (adj. RR 1.13; 95\% CI: 1.02\textendash 1.25) and use of paracetamol during infancy (adj. RR 1.29; 95\% CI: 1.16\textendash 1.45). The results were consistent for asthma at 7 years. The associations with prenatal paracetamol exposure were seen for different indications (pain, respiratory tract infections/influenza and fever). Maternal pain during pregnancy was the only indication that showed an association both with and without paracetamol use. Maternal paracetamol use outside pregnancy and paternal paracetamol use were not associated with asthma development. In a secondary analysis, prenatal ibuprofen exposure was positively associated with asthma at 3 years but not asthma at 7 years. ,  Conclusions: This study provides evidence that prenatal and infant paracetamol exposure have independent associations with asthma development. Our findings suggest that the associations could not be fully explained by confounding by indication.},

The Illumina methylation arrays provide an economical, high-throughput and comprehensive platform for measuring methylation status in EWASs. A number of software tools have been developed for identifying disease-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the epigenome. However, in practice, we found these tools typically had multiple parameter settings that needed to be specified and the performance of the software tools under different parameters was often unclear. To help users better understand and choose optimal parameter settings when using DNAm analysis tools, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 4 popular DMR analysis tools under 60 different parameter settings. In addition to evaluating power, precision, area under precision-recall curve, Matthews correlation coefficient, F1 score and type I error rate, we also compared several additional characteristics of the analysis results, including the size of the DMRs, overlap between the methods and execution time. The results showed that none of the software tools performed best under their default parameter settings, and power varied widely when parameters were changed. Overall, the precision of these software tools were good. In contrast, all methods lacked power when effect size was consistent but small. Across all simulation scenarios, comb-p consistently had the best sensitivity as well as good control of false-positive rate.},

Study design: Transgenic mice deficient in aquaporin 1 protein were generated by targeted gene disruption, as described previously. After a cesarean section was performed, intact, individual gestational sacs were removed from the uterus and weighed. Amniotic fluid volume, osmolality, and fetal and placental weights were determined. Data were analyzed by a 1-way analysis of variance for ranks; Dunn's post hoc test was used to analyze significant trends. Results: Analysis of 16 litters showed 35 wild-type, 52 heterozygote, and 33 aquaporin 1 knockout mice. The knockout mice had a greater volume of amniotic fluid and lower amniotic fluid osmolality than their wild-type and heterozygote counterparts. There were no significant differences in fetal or placental weights among the groups. Conclusions: Aquaporin 1 null fetuses produce a greater volume of more dilute amniotic fluid. Our findings show that aquaporin 1 water channels in fetal membranes may contribute to amniotic fluid volume regulation. We speculate that idiopathic polyhydramnios may be associated with a deficiency of aquaporin 1 channels in human fetal membranes. Transgenic aquaporin 1 knockout mice provide a unique animal of polyhydramnios.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Polyhydramnios is a condition associated with significant perinatal morbidity. While the exact pathophysiology of this condition is unknown in the absence of obvious anatomic or organic etiologies, impaired intramembranous water transport has been shown. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the water channel aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is expressed in human fetal membranes from term pregnancies with normal amniotic fluid (AF) volume. Therefore, we hypothesized that in pregnancies with idiopathic polyhydramnios, AQP1 expression might be reduced in fetal membranes from pregnancies with this AF volume disorder. STUDY DESIGN: Placentas were collected from women at term (37-40 weeks) who presented with either polyhydramnios (amniotic fluid index [AFI] {$>$}24.0 cm) or normal AF volume (AFI 5.0-23.9 cm). Immediately after delivery, the membranes (amnion and chorion) directly overlying the placenta and the free-floating reflected membranes were sampled (total of 4 samples from each placenta). RNA was isolated from each sample and expression was quantified using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and relative quantification of gene expression. RESULTS: Relative to pregnancies with normal AF volume, there was an increase in expression of the water channel AQP1 in all regions of the fetal membranes. The greatest increase (33-fold) was seen in the reflected amnion. CONCLUSION: AQP1 expression is increased in polyhydramnios. This finding suggests that alterations in AQP1 expression may be a compensatory response to and not a cause of idiopathic polyhydramnios. We speculate that therapies focused on regulating AQP1 expression may be useful for treating this condition.},

Second, we establish whether linear regression, the chosen statistical tool for the majority of studies, is appropriate and whether it is biased by the underlying distribution of DNA methylation data. Finally, we assess the sample size required for adequately powered DNA methylation association studies.},

PFAS fetal burden is best estimated in cord samples; previous studies have used either maternal plasma or serum during pregnancy as proxy, but their validity is not clear. We aimed to evaluate PFAS transfer between mother and fetus and determine its predictors in a Spanish birth cohort. METHODS: We measured perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) in maternal blood and cord serum from 66 mother-child pairs. We used Spearman's rank coefficients to correlate PFAS concentrations in first trimester maternal plasma and serum, with cord serum samples. We assessed PFAS placental transfer by calculating maternal to cord ratios and examined their association with maternal socio-demographic characteristics and child sex using linear regression models. RESULTS: Median concentrations of PFAS (ng/mL) of PFHxS, PFOS, PFOA, and PFNA in maternal plasma (0.79, 6.18, 2.85 and 0.84, respectively) and serum (0.84, 6.99, 2.97 and 0.85) were higher than in cord serum (0.40, 1.86, 1.90 and 0.32). PFBS was not detected. Positive Spearman's correlations (p-values{$<$}0.001) were found between maternal plasma and serum (⍴{$\geq$}0.80), maternal plasma and cord (⍴{$\geq$}0.66), and maternal serum and cord samples (⍴{$\geq$}0.67). Maternal plasma to cord ratios were above 1 (PFHxS: 2.35 [95\%CI: 2.05, 2.70], PFOS: 3.33 [3.05, 3.62], PFOA: 1.37 [1.27, 1.48], PFNA: 2.39 [2.18, 2.63]); maternal serum to cord ratios were similar. Maternal to cord ratios decreased with maternal age, but not with other socio-demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PFAS fetal body burden can be assessed using as proxy maternal plasma or serum collected early in pregnancy. Maternal age might influence PFAS placental transfer.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Clustering methods may be useful in epidemiology to better characterize exposures and account for their multidimensional aspects. In this context, application of clustering models allowing for highly dependent variables is of particular interest. We aimed to characterize patterns of domestic exposure to cleaning products using a novel clustering model allowing for highly dependent variables. Methods: To identify domestic cleaning patterns in a large population of French women, we used a mixture model of dependency blocks. This novel approach specifically models within-class dependencies, and is an alternative to the latent class model, which assumes conditional independence. Analyses were conducted in 19,398 participants of the E3N study (women aged 61e88 years) who completed a questionnaire regarding household cleaning habits. Results: Seven classes were identified, which differed with the frequency of cleaning tasks (e.g., dusting/ sweeping/hoovering) and use of specific products (e.g., bleach, sprays). The model also grouped the variables into conditionally independent blocks, providing a summary of the main dependencies among the variables. Conclusions: The mixture model of dependency blocks, a useful alternative to the latent class model, may have broader application in epidemiology, in particular, in the context of exposome research and growing need for data-reduction methods.},

  abstract = {Studies of the effects on pregnancy outcomes of in utero exposure to phthalates, contaminants that are widely present in the environment, have yielded conflicting results. In addition, the mode of assessment of exposure varies between studies. The aim of this review was therefore to establish a current state of knowledge of the phthalates and metabolites involved in unfavorable pregnancy outcomes. Extant data were analyzed to determine which biomarker is the best suited to assess the relation between in utero exposure to phthalates and pregnancy outcomes. This review of the literature was conducted using the database of PubMed. A search was made of studies investigating exposure to phthalates and the following birth outcomes: preterm birth (gestational age {$<$}37 weeks), change in gestational age, change in body size at birth (birth weight, length, head circumference), anti-androgenic function, decreased anogenital distance, cryptorchidism, hypospadias and congenital malformation. The methodological approach adopted in each study was examined, in particular the methods used for exposure assessment (biomarkers and/or questionnaire). Thirty-five studies were included. Premature birth and decreased anogenital distance were the most commonly reported outcomes resulting from a moderate level of exposure to phthalates. The principal metabolites detected and involved were primary metabolites of di-2(ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP) and di-n-butyl-phthalate (DnBP). No clear conclusion could be drawn with regard to gestational age at birth, body size at birth and congenital malformations. In epidemiological studies, maternal urine is the most suitable matrix to assess the association between in utero exposure to phthalates and pregnancy outcomes: in contrast to other matrices (cord blood, amniotic fluid, meconium and milk), sampling is easy, non-invasive and, can be repeated to assess exposure throughout pregnancy. Oxidative metabolites are the most relevant biomarkers since they are not prone to external contamination. Further epidemiological studies are required during pregnancy to i) determine the role of phthalates other than DEHP [currently replaced by various substitution products, in particular diisononyl-phthalate (DiNP)]; ii) establish the effect of phthalates on other outcomes (body size adjusted for gestational age, and congenital malformations); iii) determine the pathophysiological pathways; and iv) identify the most suitable time for biomarker determination of in utero exposure to phthalates.},

Objectives We investigated whether OP exposure, as measured by urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites in pregnant women and their children, was associated with attention-related outcomes among Mexican-American children living in an agricultural region of California. Methods Children were assessed at ages 3.5 years (n = 331) and 5 years (n = 323). Mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We administered the NEPSY-II visual attention subtest to children at 3.5 years and Conners' Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT) at 5 years. The K-CPT yielded a standardized attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Confidence Index score. Psychometricians scored behavior of the 5-year-olds during testing using the Hillside Behavior Rating Scale. Results Prenatal DAPs (nanomoles per liter) were nonsignificantly associated with maternal report of attention problems and ADHD at age 3.5 years but were significantly related at age 5 years [CBCL attention problems: {$\beta$} = 0.7 points; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.2\textendash 1.2; ADHD: {$\beta$} = 1.3; 95\% CI, 0.4\textendash 2.1]. Prenatal DAPs were associated with scores on the K-CPT ADHD Confidence Index {$>$} 70th percentile [odds ratio (OR) = 5.1; 95\% CI, 1.7\textendash 15.7] and with a composite ADHD indicator of the various measures (OR = 3.5; 95\% CI, 1.1\textendash 10.7). Some outcomes exhibited evidence of effect modification by sex, with associations found only among boys. There was also limited evidence of associations between child DAPs and attention. Conclusions In utero DAPs and, to a lesser extent, postnatal DAPs were associated adversely with attention as assessed by maternal report, psychometrician observation, and direct assessment. These associations were somewhat stronger at 5 years than at 3.5 years and were stronger in boys.},

Crowding is likely to worsen with increasing population size, urbanisation, and the ongoing concerns about housing shortages. Children with behavioural difficulties are at increased risk of mental and physical health problems and poorer employment prospects. Objective To test the association between the level of crowding in the home and behavioural problems in children, and to explore what factors might explain the relationship. Methods Mothers of 2576 children from the Southampton Women's Survey population-based mother-offspring cohort were interviewed. Crowding was measured at age 2~years by people per room (PPR) and behavioural problems assessed at age 3~years with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Both were analysed as continuous measures, and multivariable linear regression models were fitted, adjusting for confounding factors: gender, age, single-parent family, maternal education, receipt of benefits, and social class. Potential mediators were assessed with formal mediation analysis. Results The characteristics of the sample were broadly representative of the population in England. Median (IQR) SDQ score was 9 (6-12) and PPR was 0.75 (0.6-1). In households that were more crowded, children tended to have more behavioural problems (by 0.20 SDQ points (95\% CI 0.08, 0.32) per additional 0.2 PPR, adjusting for confounding factors). This relationship was partially mediated by greater maternal stress, less sleep, and strained parent-child interactions. Conclusions Living in a more crowded home was associated with a greater risk of behavioural problems, independent of confounding factors. The findings suggest that improved housing might reduce childhood behavioural problems and that families living in crowded circumstances might benefit from greater support.},

In the placenta, the HSD11B2 gene encoding the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, which is responsible for the inactivation of maternal cortisol, is regulated by DNA methylation, and has been shown to be susceptible to stressors from the maternal environment. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined the association between DNA methylation of the HSD11B2 promoter region in the placenta of 185 healthy newborn infants and infant and maternal characteristics, as well as the association between this epigenetic variability and newborn neurobehavioral outcome assessed with the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales. Controlling for confounders, HSD11B2 methylation extent is greatest in infants with the lowest birthweights (P = 0.04), and this increasing methylation was associated with reduced scores of quality of movement (P = 0.04). Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that factors in the intrauterine environment which contribute to birth outcome may be associated with placental methylation of the HSD11B2 gene and that this epigenetic alteration is in turn associated with a prospectively predictive early neurobehavioral outcome, suggesting in some part a mechanism for the developmental origins of infant neurological health.},

While these statistics are useful for Poisson and negative binomial regression models, count data often include many zeros, a phenomenon that is often handled via zero-inflated (ZI) regression models. Building on Cameron and Windmeijer's work, we propose R2 statistics for the ZI Poisson and ZI negative binomial regression contexts. We also propose adjusted R2-like versions of these quantities to avoid inflation of these statistics due to the inclusion of irrelevant covariates in the model. The properties of the proposed measures of fit are examined via simulation, and their use is illustrated on two data sets involving counts with excess zeros.},

We show that a crucial early requirement for Foxg1 is in the induction of ventral cell fate in the telencephalon. To study later proliferative defects, we have adapted an iododeoxyuridine and bromodeoxyuridine double labeling protocol for use in the developing embryo, which allows estimation of cell cycle kinetics in a single specimen. This technique is used to demonstrate that the cell cycle is prematurely lengthened in the Foxg1-null telencephalon. These defects are first apparent at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and are most severe in the rostral telencephalon. We show that apoptosis is also reduced in the same rostral domain. These defects correspond temporally and spatially with a dramatic reduction in expression of the potent signaling molecule Fgf8. We also show that in the absence of Foxg1 an excess of neurons is produced from E11.5, depleting the progenitor pool and limiting the growth of the Foxg1(-/-) telencephalon. The increase in neurogenic division coincides with an increase in BMP signaling, as detected by immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated smad-1, -5, and -8. This study reinforces Foxg1's position as a major regulator of telencephalic neurogenesis and supports the idea that Foxg1 controls precursor proliferation via regulation of Fgf signaling and differentiation via regulation of Bmp signaling.},

Transport across the placenta could be critical for risk assessment, but the available data are sparse. The aim is to develop a method for estimating fetal exposure, via the placenta, to the most commonly-used parabens, by using a human placental perfusion model. The use of human tissue is vital for determining human fetal exposure, because animal studies are of little relevance, since the placenta exhibits significant interspecies variation. An HPLC model is currently being established to simultaneously quantify four different parabens, namely, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben, and their main metabolite, p-hydroxybenzoic acid. With this model, we aim to determine the transport kinetics of these parabens across the human placenta, and to investigate placental metabolism, including differences in transport due to molecular characteristics. This will facilitate assessment of the risks associated with the use of paraben-containing products during pregnancy.},

Objective To investigate if quantitative measurement of the methylation at the GNAS DMRs identifies subtypes of PHP-Ib. Design and methods In 19 patients with PHP-Ib and 7 controls, methylation was characterised at the four GNAS DMRs through combined bisulfite restriction analysis and quantified through cytosine specific realtime PCR in blood lymphocyte DNA. Results A principal component analysis using the per cent of methylation at seven cytosines of the GNAS locus provided three clusters of subjects (controls n{$\frac{1}{4}$}7, autosomal dominant PHP-Ib with loss of methylation restricted to the A/B DMR n{$\frac{1}{4}$}3, and sporadic PHP-Ib with broad GNAS methylation changes n{$\frac{1}{4}$}16) that matched perfectly the combined bisulfite restriction analysis classification. Furthermore, three sub-clusters of patients with sporadic PHP-Ib, that displayed different patterns of methylation, were identified: incomplete changes at all DMRs compatible with somatic mosaicism (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}5), profound epigenetic changes at all DMRs (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}8), and unmodified methylation at XL in contrast with the other DMRs (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}3). Interestingly, parathyroid hormone concentration at the time of diagnosis correlated with the per cent of methylation at the A/B DMR. Conclusion Quantitative assessment of the methylation in blood lymphocyte DNA is of clinical relevance, allows the diagnosis of PHP-Ib, and identifies subtypes of PHPIb. These epigenetic findings suggest mosaicism at least in some patients.},

  abstract = {Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the most commonly used drug in the world, with a long record of use in acute and chronic pain. In recent years, the benefits of paracetamol use in chronic conditions has been questioned, notably in the areas of osteoarthritis and lower back pain. Over the same period, concerns over the long-term adverse effects of paracetamol use have increased, initially in the field of hypertension, but more recently in other areas as well. The evidence base for the adverse effects of chronic paracetamol use consists of many cohort and observational studies, with few randomized controlled trials, many of which contradict each other, so these studies must be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, there are some areas where the evidence for harm is more robust, and if a clinician is starting paracetamol with the expectation of chronic use it might be advisable to discuss these side effects with patients beforehand. In particular, an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and a small ( 4 mmHg) increase in systolic blood pressure are adverse effects for which the evidence is particularly strong, and which show a degree of dose dependence. As our estimation of the benefits decreases, an accurate assessment of the harms is ever more important. The present review summarizes the current evidence on the harms associated with chronic paracetamol use, focusing on cardiovascular disease, asthma and renal injury, and the effects of in utero exposure.},

We measured the ratio of mRNA from a maternally expressed imprinted gene, PHLDA2, to that from a paternally expressed imprinted gene, MEST, by Northern blotting in 38 IUGR-associated placentae and 75 non-IUGR placentae and found an increase in the PHLDA2/MEST mRNA ratio in IUGR (p=0.0001). Altered expression of PHLDA2 and MEST was not accompanied by changes in DNA methylation within their imprinting centers, and immunohistochemistry showed PHLDA2 protein appropriately restricted to villous and intermediate cytotrophoblast in the IUGR placentae. We next did a genome-wide survey of mRNA expression in 14 IUGR placentae with maternal vascular under-perfusion compared to 15 non-IUGR placentae using Affymetrix U133A microarrays. In this series six imprinted genes were differentially expressed by ANOVA with a Benjamini\textendash Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.05, with increased expression of PHLDA2 and decreased expression of MEST, MEG3, GATM, GNAS and PLAGL1 in IUGR placentae. At lower significance, we found IGF2 mRNA decreased and CDKN1C mRNA increased in the IUGR cases. We confirmed the significant reduction in MEG3 non-translated RNA in IUGR placentae by Northern blotting. In addition to imprinted genes, the microarray data highlighted non-imprinted genes acting in endocrine signaling (LEP, CRH, HPGD, INHBA), tissue growth (IGF1), immune modulation (INDO, PSG-family genes), oxidative metabolism (GLRX), vascular function (AGTR1, DSCR1) and metabolite transport (SLC-family solute carriers) as differentially expressed in IUGR vs. non-IUGR placentae.},

The estimates have the attractive property of being invariant under groupwise orthogonal reparameterizations. We extend the group lasso to logistic regression models and present an efficient algorithm, that is especially suitable for high dimensional problems, which can also be applied to generalized linear models to solve the corresponding convex optimization problem. The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sample size but with sparse true underlying structure. We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical. The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.},

As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularisation for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for randomised Lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions needed for consistency of the original Lasso method are violated.

  abstract = {Variance between studies in a meta-analysis will exist. This heterogeneity may be of clinical, methodological or statistical origin. The last of these is quantified by the I(2) -statistic. We investigated, using simulated studies, the accuracy of I(2) in the assessment of heterogeneity and the effects of heterogeneity on the predictive value of meta-analyses. The relevance of quantifying I(2) was determined according to the likely presence of heterogeneity between studies (low, high, or unknown) and the calculated I(2) (low or high). The findings were illustrated by published meta-analyses of selective digestive decontamination and weaning protocols. As expected, I(2) increases and the likelihood of drawing correct inferences from a meta-analysis decreases with increasing heterogeneity. With low levels of heterogeneity, I(2) does not appear to be predictive of the accuracy of the meta-analysis result. With high levels of heterogeneity, even meta-analyses with low I(2) -values have low predictive values. Most commonly, the level of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis will be unknown. In these scenarios, I(2) determination may help to identify estimates with low predictive values (high I(2) ). In this situation, the results of a meta-analysis will be unreliable. With low I(2) -values and unknown levels of heterogeneity, predictive values of pooled estimates may range extensively, and findings should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, quantifying statistical heterogeneity through I(2) -statistics is only helpful when the amount of clinical heterogeneity is unknown and I(2) is high. Objective methods to quantify the levels of clinical and methodological heterogeneity are urgently needed to allow reliable determination of the accuracy of meta-analyses.},

Design, Setting, and Participants: A total of 192 consecutive unrelated CAH patients being seen as part of an observational study at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (Bethesda, MD) were prospectively studied during 2006 \textendash 2010. Patients were evaluated for clinical evidence of EDS, including cardiac evaluation. DNA was analyzed by PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, Southern blot, and TNXB sequencing. Tenascin-X expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis of fibroblasts and immunostaining of the skin. CAH patients with TNXB haploinsufficiency were compared with age-matched CAH patients with normal TNXB (controls). Phenotyping of 7 parents with TNXB haploinsufficiency was performed. Main Outcome Measures: The frequency of TNXB haploinsufficiency among CAH patients and the frequency of EDS symptomatology among CAH patients with TNXB haploinsufficiency and controls. Results: TNXB haploinsufficiency, here termed CAH-X syndrome, was present in 7\% of CAH patients. Twelve of 91 patients carrying a CYP21A2 deletion (13\%) carried a contiguous deletion that extended into TNXB. One patient carried a TNXB premature stop codon. Twelve of 13 patients with CAH-X had EDS clinical features. Patients with CAH-X were more likely than age-matched controls to have joint hypermobility (P Ͻ .001), chronic joint pain (P ϭ .003), multiple joint dislocations (P ϭ .004), a structural cardiac valve abnormality by echocardiography (P ϭ .02), and reduced tenascin-X expression by Western blot and immunostaining. A subset of parents had clinical findings. Conclusions: Clinical evaluation for connective tissue dysplasia should be routinely performed in CAH patients, especially those harboring a CYP21A2 deletion.

  abstract = {Given the possible critical importance of placental gene imprinting and random monoallelic expression on fetal and infant health, most of those genes must be identified, in order to understand the risks that the baby might meet during pregnancy and after birth. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to introduce a workflow and tools for analyzing imprinted and random monoallelic gene expression in human placenta, by applying whole-transcriptome (WT) RNA sequencing of placental tissue and genotyping of coding DNA variants in family trios. Ten family trios, each with a healthy spontaneous single-term pregnancy, were recruited. Total RNA was extracted for WT analysis, providing the full sequence information for the placental transcriptome. Parental and child blood DNA genotypes were analyzed by exome SNP genotyping microarrays, mapping the inheritance and estimating the abundance of parental expressed alleles. Imprinted genes showed consistent expression from either parental allele, as demonstrated by the SNP content of sequenced transcripts, while monoallelically expressed genes had random activity of parental alleles. We revealed 4 novel possible imprinted genes (LGALS8, LGALS14, PAPPA2 and SPTLC3) and confirmed the imprinting of 4 genes (AIM1, PEG10, RHOBTB3 and ZFAT-AS1) in human placenta. The major finding was the identification of 4 genes (ABP1, BCLAF1, IFI30 and ZFAT) with random allelic bias, expressing one of the parental alleles preferentially. The main functions of the imprinted and monoallelically expressed genes included: i) mediating cellular apoptosis and tissue development; ii) regulating inflammation and immune system; iii) facilitating metabolic processes; and iv) regulating cell cycle.},

While telomere length appears to be influenced by hormone levels, the potential impact of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has not been studied. We examined the association between maternal gestational concentrations of biomarkers of EDC exposure and telomere length at birth in the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort. EDC (phenols and phthalates) biomarker concentrations were measured in maternal spot urine samples during the first trimester and telomere length in maternal and cord blood collected at delivery among 181 mother-newborn singleton dyads. Maternal and newborn telomere length exhibited a positive correlation (Spearman {$\rho~$}=~0.20 (p-value{$<$} 0.01). Infant telomere length was associated with maternal biomarker concentrations of specific EDCs, and most of these associations were observed to be infant sex-specific. Prenatal exposure to triclosan, a non-paraben phenol with antimicrobial properties, was one of the most strongly associated EDCs with telomere length; telomere length was 20\% (95\% CI 5\%\textendash 33\%) shorter among boys in the highest quartile of maternal biomarker concentrations compared to the lowest quartile. In contrast, we observed longer telomere length associated with increased gestational concentrations of mono-isobutyl phthalate, and among boys, with increased concentrations of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate. In this birth cohort, we observed associations between maternal gestational exposure to select EDC biomarkers and telomere length, most of which were sex-specific. These findings need to be confirmed in future studies.},

We evaluated to what extent this association is explained by confounding. Methods We investigated the association between maternal paracetamol use in the first and third trimester of pregnancy and ever wheezing or recurrent wheezing/asthma in infants in the NINFEA cohort study. Risks ratios (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated after adjustment for confounders, including maternal infections and antibiotic use during pregnancy. Results The prevalence of maternal paracetamol use was 30.6\% during the first and 36.7\% during the third trimester of pregnancy. The prevalence of ever wheezing and recurrent wheezing/ asthma was 16.9\% and 5.6\%, respectively. After full adjustment, the RR for ever wheezing decreased from 1.25 [1.07\textendash 1.47] to 1.10 [0.94\textendash 1.30] in the first, and from 1.26 [1.08\textendash 1.47] to 1.10 [0.93\textendash 1.29] in the third trimester. A similar pattern was observed for recurrent wheezing/asthma. Duration of maternal paracetamol use was not associated with either outcome. Further analyses on paracetamol use for three non-infectious disorders (sciatica, migraine, and headache) revealed no increased risk of wheezing in children. Conclusion The association between maternal paracetamol use during pregnancy and infant wheezing is mainly, if not completely explained by confounding.},

  abstract = {Background Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is activated by stretch (mechanical), warm temperature, some epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, and lipopolysaccharide. TRPV4 is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal epithelia and its activation induces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) exocytosis that is involved in visceral hypersensitivity. As an ATP transporter, vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) mediates ATP storage in secretory vesicles and ATP release via exocytosis upon stimulation. Summary TRPV4 is sensitized under inflammatory conditions by a variety of factors, including proteases and serotonin, whereas methylation-dependent silencing of TRPV4 expression is associated with various pathophysiological conditions. Gastrointestinal epithelia also release ATP in response to hypo-osmolality or acid through molecular mechanisms that remain unclear. These synergistically released ATP could be involved in visceral hypersensitivity. Low concentrations of the first generation bisphosphate, clodronate, were recently reported to inhibit VNUT activity and thus clodronate may be a safe and potent therapeutic option to treat visceral pain. Key Messages This review focuses on: (1) ATP and TRPV4 activities in gastrointestinal epithelia; (2) factors that could modulate TRPV4 activity in gastrointestinal epithelia; and (3) the inhibition of VNUT as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for functional gastrointestinal disorders.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic compound used in the production of many polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. It is one of the most widely produced chemicals in the world today and is found in most canned goods, plastics, and even household dust. Exposure to BPA is almost universal: most people have measurable amounts of BPA in both urine and serum. BPA is similar in structure to estradiol and can bind to multiple targets both inside and outside the nucleus, in effect acting as an endocrine disruptor. Research on BPA exposure has accelerated in the past decade with findings suggesting that perinatal exposure to BPA can negatively impact both male and female reproduction, create alterations in behavior, and act as a carcinogen. BPA can have both short term and long term effects with the latter typically occurring through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. This review will draw on both human and animal studies in an attempt to synthesize the literature and examine the effects of BPA exposure on reproduction, behavior, and carcinogenesis with a focus on the potential epigenetic mechanisms by which it acts.},

The \emph{CYP21A2} gene is partially overlapped by the \emph{TNXB} gene, which encodes an extracellular matrix protein called Tenascin-X (TNX). Mutations affecting both alleles of \emph{TNXB} cause a severe, autosomal recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Rarely, patients with severe, salt-wasting CAH have deletions of \emph{CYP21A2} that extend into \emph{TNXB}, resulting in a ``contiguous gene syndrome'' consisting of CAH and EDS. Heterozygosity for \emph{TNXB} mutations causing haploinsufficiency of TNX may be associated with the mild ``hypermobility form'' of EDS, which principally affects small and large joints. Studies of patients with salt-wasting CAH found that up to 10\% had clinical features of EDS, associated joint hypermobility, haploinsufficiency of TNX and heterozygosity for \emph{TNXB} mutations, now called ``CAH-X.'' These patients have joint hypermobility and a spectrum of other comorbidities associated with their connective tissue disorder, including chronic arthralgia, joint subluxations, hernias, and cardiac defects. Other disorders are beginning to be associated with TNX deficiency, including familial vesicoureteral reflux and neurologic disorders. Further work is needed to delineate the full spectrum of TNX-deficient disorders, with and without associated CAH.},

These CpGs were overrepresented in open sea and shore regions, as well as in intergenic regions. They also showed a strong enrichment of significant hits in association analyses. Furthermore, a significant proportion of common DNA methylation is at least partially genetically driven and thus may be observed similarly across tissues. These findings could be of particular relevance for studies of complex neuropsychiatric traits, which often rely on proxy tissues.},

This study aimed to examine associations between maternal serum levels of BPA and phthalate metabolites and behavioral problems at preschool age. Methods: The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess behavioral problems at 5 years of age. BPA and phthalate metabolite levels in the first trimester maternal serum was determined by LC-MS/MS for 458 children. Variables used for adjustment were parental ages, maternal cotinine levels, family income during pregnancy, child sex, birth order, and age at SDQ completed. Results: The median concentrations of BPA, MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MECPP, primary and secondary metabolites of phthalates, were 0.062, 26.0, 7.0, 1.40, and 0.20 ng/ml, respectively. MECPP level was associated with increase conduct problem risk (OR = 2.78, 95\% CI 1.36\textendash 5.68) overall and the association remained after child sex stratification, and odds ratios were increased with wider confidence interval (OR = 2.85, 95\% CI 1.07\textendash 7.57 for boys, OR = 4.04, 95\% CI 1.31\textendash 12.5 for girls, respectively). BPA, {$\sum$}DBPm (MnBP + MiBP), and {$\sum$}DEHPm (MEHP+MECPP) levels were not associated with any of the child behavioral problems. Conclusions: Our analyses found no significant association between BPA or summation of phthalate metabolite levels and any of the behavioral problems at 5 years of age but suggested possible association between MECPP levels and increased risk of conduct problems.},

Experimental evidence suggests that several phthalates possess antiandrogenic properties and may disrupt endocrine pathways resulting in abnormal reproductive outcomes. Low-level exposure to phthalates has been well documented in humans, with higher levels found in children and women of childbearing age. Recent epidemiologic studies postulate that prenatal exposure to measurable urine phthalate concentrations may be associated with altered genital and pubertal development in infants and children. This review addresses the emerging evidence that some phthalates may have an adverse impact on the developing brain. The supporting animal studies and proposed mechanisms underlying the deleterious properties of phthalates in relation to neurodevelopmental outcomes are also discussed. While the observed associations are based on limited studies with a broad range of endpoints, the implications of such outcomes are of concern from a public health standpoint and merit further investigation given the widespread nature of the exposure.},

We previously demonstrated specific perturbations of fertilization, blastocyst formation, implantation, as well as aberrant glucose metabolism and adiposity in offspring using a mouse model of paternal obesity. The current investigation analyzed gene expression and methylation of specific CpG residues in F1 placentas of pregnancies fathered by obese and normal-weight male mice, using real-time PCR and bisulfite pyrosequencing. Our aim was to determine if paternal obesity deregulated placental gene expression and DNA methylation when compared to normal-weight males. Gene methylation of sperm DNA was analyzed and compared to placentas to address epigenetic transmission. Of the 10 paternally expressed genes (Pegs), 11 genes important for development and transport of nutrients, and the long-terminal repeat Intracisternal A particle (IAP) elements, derived from a member of the class II endogenous retroviral gene family, we observed a significant effect of paternal diet-induced obesity on deregulated expression of Peg3, Peg9, Peg10, and the nutrient transporter gene Slc38a2, and aberrant DNA methylation of the Peg9 promoter in F1 placental tissue. Epigenetic changes in Peg9 were also found in sperm from obese fathers. We therefore propose that paternal obesity renders changes in gene expression and/or methylation throughout the placental genome, which could contribute to the reproductive problems related to fertility and to the metabolic, long-term health impact on offspring.},

We examined the associations between methylation and PFAS levels in maternal serum using robust linear regression models and identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). Results We found four DMPs with a false discovery rate below 0.05 in the discovery cohort. Among the top 20 DMPs ranked by the lowest P-values for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure, four DMPs showed the same direction of effect and P-value {$<$} 0.05 in the replication assay: cg16242615 mapped to ZBTB7A, cg21876869 located in the intergenic region (IGR) of USP2-AS1, cg00173435 mapped to TCP11L2, and cg18901140 located in IGR of NTN1. For DMRs, we found a region associated with PFOA exposure with family-wise error rate {$<$} 0.1 located in ZFP57, showing the same direction of effect in the replication cohort. Among the top five DMRs ranked by the lowest P-values that were associated with exposure to PFOS and PFOA, in addition to ZFP57, DMRs in the CYP2E1, SMAD3, SLC17A9, GFPT2, DUSP22, and TCERG1L genes showed the same direction of effect in the replication cohort. Conclusion We suggest that prenatal exposure to PFASs may affect DNA methylation status at birth. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether methylation changes observed are associated with differential health outcomes.},

Differential DNA methylation at specific CpG sites may link BPA exposure to health impacts. We examined the association of prenatal BPA exposure with genome-wide DNA methylation changes in cord blood in 277 mother-child pairs in the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health, using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip. We observed that a large portion of BPA-associated differentially methylated CpGs with p-value\,{$<$}\,0.0001 was hypomethylated among all newborns (91\%) and female infants (98\%), as opposed to being hypermethylated (88\%) among males. We found 27 and 16 CpGs with a false discovery rate (FDR)\,{$<$}\,0.05 in the analyses for males and females, respectively. Genes annotated to FDR-corrected CpGs clustered into an interconnected genetic network among males, while they rarely exhibited any interactions in females. In contrast, none of the enrichment for gene ontology (GO) terms with FDR\,{$<$}\,0.05 was observed for genes annotated to the male-specific CpGs with p\,{$<$}\,0.0001, whereas the female-specific genes were significantly enriched for GO terms related to cell adhesion.

  abstract = {Genomic imprinting is a developmentally important mechanism that involves both differential DNA methylation and allelic histone modifications. Through detailed comparative characterization, a large imprinted domain mapping to chromosome 7q21 in humans and proximal chromosome 6 in mice was redefined. This domain is organized around a maternally methylated CpG island comprising the promoters of the adjacent PEG10 and SGCE imprinted genes. Examination of Dnmt3l-/+ conceptuses shows that imprinted expression for all genes of the cluster depends upon the germline methylation at this putative ``imprinting control region'' (ICR). Similarly as for other ICRs, we find its DNA-methylated allele to be associated with trimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me3) and trimethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me3), whereas the transcriptionally active paternal allele is enriched in H3K4me2 and H3K9 acetylation. Our study reveals a novel placenta-specific transcript, TFPI2, which is expressed from the maternal allele in both humans and mice. Deficiency for the histone methyltransferase EHMT2 (also known as G9A) or for the Polycomb group protein EED, involved in repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 respectively, leads to biallelic expression of Tfpi2 in the extra-embryonic lineages, whereas the other genes in the cluster maintain correct imprinting. Apart from the putative ICR, however, no other promoter regions within the domain exhibited allele-specific repressive histone modifications. This unexpected general lack of repressive histone modifications suggests that this domain may utilize a different silencing mechanism as compared to other imprinted domains.},

  abstract = {With the launch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/National Institutes of Health Human Placenta Project, the anticipation is that this oftenoverlooked organ will be the subject of much intense research. Compared with somatic tissues, the cells of the placenta have a unique epigenetic profile that dictates its transcription patterns, which when disturbed may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. One major class of genes that is dependent on strict epigenetic regulation in the placenta is subject to genomic imprinting, the parent-of-origin-dependent monoallelic gene expression. This review discusses the differences in allelic expression and epigenetic profiles of imprinted genes that are identified between different species, which reflect the continuous evolutionary adaption of this form of epigenetic regulation. These observations divulge that placenta-specific imprinted gene that is reliant on repressive histone signatures in mice are unlikely to be imprinted in humans, whereas intense methylation profiling in humans has uncovered numerous maternally methylated regions that are restricted to the placenta that are not conserved in mice. Imprinting has been proposed to be a mechanism that regulates parental resource allocation and ultimately can influence fetal growth, with the placenta being the key in this process. Furthermore, I discuss the developmental dynamics of both classic and transient placenta-specific imprinting and examine the evidence for an involvement of these genes in intrauterine growth restriction and placenta-associated complications. Finally, I focus on examples of genes that are regulated aberrantly in complicated pregnancies, emphasizing their application as pregnancy-related disease biomarkers to aid the diagnosis of at-risk pregnancies early in gestation.},

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) pose a public health risk through disruption of normal biological processes. Identifying toxicoepigenetic mechanisms of developmental exposure-induced effects for EDCs, such as phthalates or bisphenol A (BPA), is essential. Here, we investigate whether maternal exposure to EDCs is predictive of infant DNA methylation at candidate gene regions. In the Michigan Mother-Infant Pairs (MMIP) cohort, DNA was extracted from cord blood leukocytes for methylation analysis by pyrosequencing (n = 116) and methylation changes related to first trimester levels of 9 phthalate metabolites and BPA. Growth and metabolism-related genes selected for methylation analysis included imprinted (IGF2, H19) and non-imprinted (PPARA, ESR1) genes along with LINE-1 repetitive elements. Findings revealed decreases in methylation of LINE-1, IGF2, and PPARA with increasing phthalate concentrations. For example, a log unit increase in {$\Sigma$}DEHP corresponded to a 1.03 [95\% confidence interval (CI): -1.83, -0.22] percentage point decrease in PPARA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation were also inversely correlated with PPARA gene expression determined by RT-qPCR (r = -0.34, P = 0.02), thereby providing evidence in support of functional relevance. A sex-stratified analysis of EDCs and DNA methylation showed that some relationships were female-specific. For example, urinary BPA exposure was associated with a 1.35 (95\%CI: -2.69, -0.01) percentage point decrease in IGF2 methylation and a 1.22 (95\%CI: -2.27, -0.16) percentage point decrease in PPARA methylation in females only. These findings add to a body of evidence suggesting epigenetically labile regions may provide a conduit linking early exposures with disease risk later in life and that toxicoepigenetic susceptibility may be sex specific.},

In this study, we validated previous observations on abnormal levels of circulating messenger RNA (mRNA) for the tenascin-X gene in pregnancies with ventricular septal defects in the second trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: This was a bicentric retrospective study conducted from March 2016 to July 2017. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify abnormally expressed genes, comparing ten women carrying a euploid fetus with ventricular septal defects to 30 controls at 19-24~weeks of gestation. The univariable analysis was used to determine whether the mean mRNA for the tenascin-X gene values would differ from the expected values for the controls. RESULTS: mRNA for tenascin-X gene values was higher in ventricular septal defects, 4.38~{$\pm~$}3.01 versus 1.00~{$\pm~$}0.80. The result was still significant even after adjustment for gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm previous studies on the specific association of mRNA species and type of congenital heart defect and confirm that ventricular septal defects are associated with abnormal mRNA for the tenascin-X gene. The positive predictive value of this molecular marker in the general population should be assessed through prospective studies.},

  abstract = {The activation of the APC/beta-catenin signalling pathway due to beta-catenin mutations has been implicated in the development of a subset of endometrial carcinomas (ECs). However, up to 25\% of ECs have beta-catenin nuclear accumulation without evidence of beta-catenin mutations, suggesting alterations of other molecules that can modulate the Wnt pathway, such as APC, gamma-catenin, AXIN1 and AXIN2. We investigated the expression pattern of beta- and gamma-catenin in a group of 128 endometrial carcinomas, including 95 endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (EECs) and 33 non-endometrioid endometrial carcinomas (NEECs). In addition, we evaluated the presence of loss of heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation of the APC gene and mutations in the APC, beta- and gamma-catenin, AXIN1, AXIN2, and RAS genes, and phospho-Akt expression. No APC mutations were detected but LOH at the APC locus was found in 24.3\% of informative cases. APC promoter 1A hypermethylation was observed in 46.6\% of ECs, and was associated with the endometrioid phenotype (P=0.034) and microsatellite instability (P=0.008). Neither LOH nor promoter hypermethylation of APC was associated with nuclear catenin expression. Nuclear beta-catenin expression was found in 31.2\% of EECs and 3\% of NEECs (P=0.002), and was significantly associated with beta-catenin gene exon 3 mutations (P{$<$}0.0001). beta-catenin gene exon 3 mutations were associated with the endometrioid phenotype, and were detected in 14 (14.9\%) EECs, but in none of the NEECs (P=0.02). gamma-catenin nuclear expression was found in 10 ECs; it was not associated with the histological type but was associated with more advanced stages (P=0.042). No mutations in gamma-catenin, AXIN1 and 2 genes were detected in this series. Neither RAS mutations nor phospho-Akt expression, which were found in 16 and 27.6\% of the cases, respectively, were associated with beta-catenin nuclear expression. Our results demonstrated a high prevalence of alterations in molecules of the APC/beta-catenin pathway, but only mutations in beta-catenin gene are associated with aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin.},

To facilitate the evaluation of the biological and evolutionary significance of imprinting, we have collated a census of known imprinted genes, listing 83 transcriptional units of which 29 are imprinted in both humans and mice. There is a high level of discordance of imprinting status between the mouse and human, even when cases in which the orthologue is absent from one species are excluded. A high proportion of imprinted genes are noncoding RNAs or genes derived by retrotransposition. Accumulation of functional and comparative data for these genes will improve our understanding of imprinting and its contribution to mammalian evolution.},

GAS5 and GR{$\alpha$} were the predominant transcripts in both term and preterm placentas, with GAS5 being primarily localized in the syncytiotrophoblasts. In an attempt to mimic moderate and high stress environment in vitro, BeWo and JEG-3 cytotrophoblast cell lines were treated with 10\,nM\textendash 1000\,nM cortisol. Only expression of GAS5 was significantly upregulated by cortisol in all treatments compared with basal levels, but none of the GRs changed expression significantly. In an attempt to assess a stress versus gene interaction, we studied four GR polymorphisms. In the homozygous group for Tth111I polymorphism, mothers with negative attitudes towards the pregnancy gave birth to infants with significantly lower birth weights compared to women with positive/neutral attitudes. None of the GR splice variants were associated with maternal stress. However, placental GAS5 levels were inversely correlated with maternal stress. This study points towards a potential gene-environment interaction that could be of predictive value for fetal weight.},

  abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants comprised of organic chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzo-pdioxins, dibenzofurans and organochlorinated pesticides which have many characteristics in common. Once released in the environment they resist physical, biological, chemical and photochemical breakdown processes and thus persist in the environment. They are subject to long transboundary air pollution transport. They accumulate in the food chain due to their lipophilicity, bioaccumulation and biomagnification properties. Human exposure occurs through inhalation of air, ingestion of food and skin contact. Because most of them bioaccumulate and remain preferentially in fat, their long-term effects are still a matter of public health concern. They are condemned for health adverse effects such as cancer, reproductive defects, neurobehavioral abnormalities, endocrine and immunological toxicity. These effects can be elicited via a number of mechanisms among others include disruption of endocrine system, oxidation stress and epigenetic. However most of the mechanisms are not clear thus a number of studies are ongoing trying to elucidate them. In this review, the underlying possible mechanisms of action and their possible roles in adverse developmental and reproductive processes are discussed and where possible a linkage is made to some existing epidemiological data. Both genomic and nongenomic pathways are used to describe these effects. Understanding of these mechanisms will enable development of strategies to protect the public by reducing these adverse effects. This review is limited to persistent organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (NL-HCH) and endosulfan.},

  abstract = {The effect of bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on human brain and behavior is a relatively new issue, and particular concerns have been raised about its potential impact on children. The primary objective of this review was to analyze the current state of knowledge on the association of environmental BPA exposure during pregnancy and/or childhood with child cognitive and/or behavior outcomes. All scientific publications until March 2015 that include examination of this relationship have been reviewed using the MEDLINE/PubMed database. Although research on this issue has not been abundant, an association with altered neurobehavior was reported by eight out of the twelve available articles, including aggressive behavior, attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, depression and anxiety impairments, mostly in children exposed in utero, indicating disruption of the brain during this critical window of development. Despite the reduced number of studies and their heterogeneity, the results suggest that prenatal BPA exposure may have a negative impact on neurobehavioral functioning in children and that the effects may be sex-dependent. It is therefore necessary to be vigilant towards the potential adverse effects of ubiquitous low-level BPA exposure, although more studies in humans are required to convincingly confirm or rule out the association between BPA exposure and health. Meanwhile, it is desirable to inform women planning or undergoing pregnancy about measures to reduce or avoid exposure to BPA. We discuss some key aspects of the relationship between exposure and neurobehavioral outcomes.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) on human brain and behavior are not novel; however, Grohs and colleagues have contributed groundbreaking data on this topic in a recent issue of Environmental Health. For the first time, associations were reported between prenatal BPA exposure and differences in children's brain microstructure, which appeared to mediate the association between this exposure and children's behavioral symptoms. Findings in numerous previous mother-child cohorts have pointed in a similar worrying direction, linking higher BPA exposure during pregnancy to more behavioral problems throughout childhood as assessed by neuropsychological questionnaires. Notwithstanding, this body of work has not been adequately considered in risk assessment. From a toxicological perspective, results are now available from the CLARITY-BPA consortium, designed to reconcile academic and regulatory toxicology findings. In fact, the brain has consistently emerged as one of the most sensitive organs disrupted by BPA, even at doses below those considered safe by regulatory agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). In this Commentary, we contextualize the results of Grohs et al. within the setting of previous epidemiologic and CLARITY-BPA data and express our disquiet about the ``all-or-nothing'' criterion adopted to select human data in a recent EFSA report on the appraisal methodology for their upcoming BPA risk assessment. We discuss the most relevant human studies, identify emerging patterns, and highlight the need for adequate assessment and interpretation of the increasing epidemiologic literature in this field in order to support decision-making. With the aim of avoiding a myopic or biased selection of a few studies in traditional risk assessment procedures, we propose a future reevaluation of BPA focused on neurotoxicity and based on a systematic and comprehensive integration of available mechanistic, animal, and human data. Taken together, the experimental and epidemiologic evidence converge in the same direction: BPA is a probable developmental neurotoxicant at low doses. Accordingly, the precautionary principle should be followed, progressively implementing stringent preventive policies worldwide, including the banning of BPA in food contact materials and thermal receipts, with a focus on the utilization of safer substitutes.},

In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that in utero exposure to the endocrine active compound, bisphenol A (BPA), influences expression and epigenetic regulation of phase I and II XME genes during development. Using healthy 1st to 2nd trimester human fetal liver specimens quantified for internal BPA levels, we examined XME gene expression using PCR Array (n =8) and RNA-sequencing (n =12) platforms. Of the greater than 160 XME genes assayed, 2 phase I and 12 phase II genes exhibited significantly reduced expression with higher BPA levels, including isoforms from the carboxylesterase, catechol O-methyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase, sulfotransferase, and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase families. When the promoters of these candidate genes were evaluated in silico, putative binding sites for the Etwenty-six (ETS) and activator protein1 (AP1) related transcription factor families were identified and unique to 97\% of all candidate transcripts. Interestingly, many ETS binding sites contain cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) within their consensus sequences. Thus, quantitative analysis of CpG methylation of three candidate genes was conducted across n =50 samples. Higher BPA levels were associated with increased site-specific methylation at COMT (P {$<$}0.005) and increased average methylation at SULT2A1 (P {$<$}0.020) promoters. While toxicological studies have traditionally focused on high-dose effects and hormonal receptor mediated regulation, our findings suggest the importance of low-dose effects and nonclassical mechanisms of endocrine disruption during development.},

This is especially important for the endocrine active compound, bisphenol A (BPA), where studies investigating internal doses at sensitive periods of human development are currently lacking. Herein, BPA concentrations, BPA-specific metabolizing enzyme gene expression, and global DNA methylation were characterized across three matched tissues from elective pregnancy terminations of 2nd trimester human fetuses: the placenta, liver, and kidney (N=12 each; N=36 total). Compared to liver (free: 0.54-50.5 ng/g), BPA concentrations were lower in matched placenta ({$<$}0.05-25.4 ng/g) and kidney (0.08-11.1 ng/g) specimens. BPA-specific metabolism gene expression of GUSB, UGT2B15, STS, and SULT1A1 differed across each tissue type; however, conjugation and deconjugation expression patterns were similar across the fetus. Average LINE1 and CCGG global methylation were 58.3 and 59.2\% in placenta, 79.5 and 66.4\% in fetal liver, and 77.9 and 77.0\% in fetal kidney, with significant tissuespecific DNA methylation differences in both LINE1 (p-value {$<$}0.001) and CCGG content (pvalue {$<$}0.001). Total BPA concentrations were positively associated with global methylation for the placenta only using the LINE1 assay (p-value: 0.002), suggesting organ-specific biological effects after fetal exposure. Utilizing sensitive human clinical specimens, results are informative for BPA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics assessment in the developing human fetus.},

Thus, there is an increasing concern about environmental exposure of humans to BPA. In the present study, we used experimentally controlled cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to assess the influence of prenatal exposure to BPA (10 microg/(kg day)) via subcutaneously implanted pumps and examined social behaviors between infants and their mothers during the suckling period. Mother-infant interactions in cynomolgus monkeys had behavioral sexual dimorphism associated with sex of infant from early suckling period. Prenatal exposure to BPA altered the behaviors of male infants significantly; BPA-exposed male infants behaved as female infants. And it also affected some of female infant behaviors. Consequently, gestational BPA exposure altered some behaviors of their mothers, mainly in male-nursing mothers. These results suggest that BPA exposure affects behavioral sexual differentiation in male monkeys, which promotes the understanding of risk of BPA exposure in human.},

Our study aimed to assess the relationship between in-utero exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A and other phenolic compounds (parabens, triclosan, dichlorophenols and benzophenone-3) and the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of boys at 5\textendash 6 years. Methods: In 452 mother-son dyads from the French EDEN cohort, we measured 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenolic compounds (4 parabens, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A, 2 dichlorophenols and triclosan) in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. Verbal and performance IQ of children were assessed at 5\textendash 6 years by a psychologist using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). We used adjusted Structural Equation Models (SEM) combined with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction to assess the associations between maternal urine phenol and phthalate metabolite concentrations considered simultaneously and the boys' IQ. Results: No phenol or phthalate metabolite concentration was negatively associated with the boys' verbal or performance IQ (uncorrected p-values {$\geq$}0.09). Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate tended to be associated with increased verbal IQ ({$\beta$} = 0.136, 95\% confidence interval, 0.01; 0.27). This association disappeared after correction for multiple comparison (corrected p-value, 0.71). Conclusion: Our results did not provide evidence of an inverse association between in-utero exposure to phenols or phthalates and verbal and performance IQ among boys. Since phenols and phthalates may have sex-specific effects, these null findings cannot be generalized to girls. Limitations included use of a single spot urine sample to assess exposures and lack of consideration of postnatal exposures.},

However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the research questions and analysis plan before observing the research outcomes\textemdash a process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A variety of practical strategies are available to make the best possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services are now available for preregistration across all disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice.

This is accompanied by a general move away from a proliferative, immature phenotype. Genome-scale expression studies have provided valuable insight into genes that are associated with the shift to both an invasive EVCT and ST phenotype, whereas genome-scale DNA methylation analysis has shown that differentiation to ST involves widespread methylation shifts, which are counteracted by low oxygen. In the current study, we sought to identify DNA methylation variation that is associated with transition from CTB to ST in vitro and from a noninvasive to invasive EVCT phenotype after culture on Matrigel. Of the several hundred differentially methylated regions that were identified in each comparison, the majority showed a loss of methylation with differentiation. This included a large differentially methylated region (DMR) in the gene body of death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX), which lost methylation during both CTB syncytialization to ST and EVCT differentiation to invasive EVCT. Comparison to publicly available methylation array data identified the same DMR as among the most consistently differentially methylated genes in placental samples from preeclampsia pregnancies. Of interest, in vitro culture of CTB or ST in low oxygen increases methylation in the same region, which correlates with delayed differentiation. Analysis of combined epigenomics signatures confirmed DAXX DMR as a likely regulatory element, and direct gene expression analysis identified a positive association between methylation at this site and DAXX expression levels. The widespread dynamic nature of DAXX methylation in association with trophoblast differentiation and placenta-associated pathologies is consistent with an important role for this gene in proper placental development and function.\textemdash Novakovic, B., Evain-Brion, D., Murthi, P., Fournier, T., Saffery, R.

  abstract = {Background: Organophosphate pesticides are widely used in agriculture and for other purposes, leading to ubiquitous exposure in human populations. Some studies reported cognitive deficits in children exposed pre\- natally to organophosphate pesticides, but findings from recent studies were inconsistent. Furthermore, recent biomonitoring studies suggest exposure levels have decreased. Hence, the risks from current prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides for child neurodevelopment are uncertain. Furthermore, sex-differences also remain to be better documented in relation to potential neurodevelopmental effects. Objective: To examine the association between prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides and IQ scores among boys and girls living in several major Canadian cities. Methods: We used data from the MIREC cohort (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals). Women were recruited in 2008\textendash 2011 from 10 Canadian cities during their first trimester of pregnancy, and urine spot samples were collected for measurement of three dimethyl alkyl phosphate (DMAP) and three diethyl alkyl phosphate (DEAP) metabolites. When children were 3\textendash 4 years of age, we used the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III (WPPSI-III) to assess cognitive ability of children from 6 out of the 10 cities (Halifax, Hamilton, Kingston, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver). We analysed the association between maternal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (DMAP and DEAP urinary metabolites) and children's IQ scores with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to take into account the clustered-data resulting from the six study sites. All analyses were sex-stratified (n = 296 boys and 311 girls). Results: The participants were predominantly well-educated, white women, with a relatively high household income. Children had a mean age of 3.4 years at the moment of IQ assessment (range, 3.0\textendash 4.1 years). In girls, there was no association between IQ scores and DEAPs or DMAPs. Higher concentrations of DEAPs were significantly associated with poorer Verbal IQ scores (for a 10-fold increase in concentrations, - 6.28; 95\% CIs, - 12.13, - 0.43) in boys. The association for Performance IQ in boys also indicated poorer scores with higher DEAP concentrations, but the confidence intervals included the null value (- 4.05; 95\% CIs, - 10.19, 2.10). The relation between DMAPs and IQ scores in boys was also negative, but association estimates were small and not significant. Conclusion: Urinary metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were not associated with IQ in girls, but we observed that higher maternal urinary DEAPs were associated with poorer Verbal IQ in boys. However, exposure misclassification may be an issue as only one urine sample per woman was analysed. The present study con\- tributes to the accumulating evidence linking exposure to organophosphate pesticides during fetal development},

However, variations in urinary creatinine (a measure of dilution) or serum lipid levels, if not adequately corrected for, can directly impact biomarker concentrations and bias exposure-disease association measures. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent methodological literature has considered the complex relationships between creatinine or serum lipid levels, exposure biomarkers, outcomes, and other potentially relevant factors using directed acyclic graphs and simulation studies. The optimal measures of urinary dilution and serum lipids have also been investigated. Existing evidence supports the use of covariate-adjusted standardization plus creatinine adjustment for urinary biomarkers and standardization plus serum lipid adjustment for lipophilic, serum-based biomarkers. It is unclear which urinary dilution measure is best, but all serum lipid measures performed similarly. Future research should assess methods for pooled biomarkers and for studying diseases and exposures that affect creatinine or serum lipids directly.},

Low birth weight predisposes these infants to an increased risk of developing cardiovascular, metabolic and neurodevelopmental conditions in later life. However, our understanding of how this pathology occurs is currently incomplete. Previous research has focused on understanding the transcriptome, epigenome and bacterial signatures separately. However, we hypothesise that interactions between moderators of gene expression are critical to understanding fetal growth restriction. Through a review of the current literature, we identify that there is evidence of modulated expression/methylation of the placental genome and the presence of bacterial DNA in the placental tissue of SGA infants. We also identify that despite limited evidence of the interactions between the above results, there are promising suggestions of a relationship between bacterial signatures and placental function. This review aims to summarise the current literature concerning fetal growth from multiple avenues and propose a novel relationship between the placental transcriptome, methylome and bacterial signature that, if characterised, may be able to improve our current understanding of the placental response to stress and the aetiology of growth restriction.},

  abstract = {Background The association between exposure to perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis has been sparsely investigated in humans and the findings are inconsistent. Objectives A matched case-control study was conducted to investigate the association between fetal exposure to PFCs and ADHD diagnosis in childhood. Methods The study base comprised children born in Malm\"o, Sweden, between 1978 and 2000 that were followed up until 2005. Children with ADHD (n = 206) were identified at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Controls (n = 206) were selected from the study base and were matched for year of birth and maternal country of birth. PFC concentrations were measured in umbilical cord serum samples. The differences of the PFC concentrations between cases and controls were investigated using Wilcoxon's paired test. Possible threshold effects (above the upper quartile for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and above limit of detection [LOD] for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)) were evaluated by conditional logistic regression. Results The median umbilical cord serum concentrations of PFOS were 6.92 ng/ml in the cases and 6.77 ng/ml in the controls. The corresponding concentrations of PFOA were 1.80 and 1.83 ng/ml. No associations between PFCs and ADHD were observed. Odds ratios adjusted for smoking status, parity, and gestational age were 0.81 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.50 to 1.32) for PFOS, 1.07 (95\% CI 0.67 to 1.7) for PFOA, and 1.1 (95\% CI 0.75 to 1.7) for PFNA. Conclusions The current study revealed no support for an association between fetal exposure to PFOS, PFOA, or PFNA and ADHD.},

  abstract = {White blood cells (WBCs) mediate immune systems and consist of various subtypes with distinct roles. Elucidation of the mechanism that regulates the counts of the WBC subtypes would provide useful insights into both the etiology of the immune system and disease pathogenesis. In this study, we report results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a replication study for the counts of the 5 main WBC subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils) using 14,792 Japanese subjects enrolled in the BioBank Japan Project. We identified 12 significantly associated loci that satisfied the genome-wide significance threshold of P{$<$}5.0\texttimes 10-8, of which 9 loci were novel (the CDK6 locus for the neutrophil count; the ITGA4, MLZE, STXBP6 loci, and the MHC region for the monocyte count; the SLC45A3-NUCKS1, GATA2, NAALAD2, ERG loci for the basophil count). We further evaluated associations in the identified loci using 15,600 subjects from Caucasian populations. These WBC subtype-related loci demonstrated a variety of patterns of pleiotropic associations within the WBC subtypes, or with total WBC count, platelet count, or red blood cell-related traits (n = 30,454), which suggests unique and common functional roles of these loci in the processes of hematopoiesis. This study should contribute to the understanding of the genetic backgrounds of the WBC subtypes and hematological traits.},

Human epidemiological studies of exposure-related deviations of children's behaviors are sparse. We assessed the associations between prenatal, 5- and 7-year PFAS exposures and behavioral problem scores in 7-year Faroese children. Methods Concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) were measured in maternal serum and in serum from children at ages 5 and 7 years (n=539, 508, and 491, respectively). We used multivariable regressions and structural equations models to estimate the covariate-adjusted associations between serum-PFAS concentrations and behavioral difficulties, as assessed by the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) at age 7. Results Serum-PFOS and PFHxS concentrations declined over time, whereas PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA tended to increase. No associations were observed between prenatal PFAS concentrations and SDQ scores. However, a two-fold increase in 5-year serum-PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA concentrations was associated with increases in total SDQ scores by 1.03 (95\% CI: 0.11, 1.95), 0.72 (95\% CI: 0.07, 1.38) and 0.78 points (95\% CI: 0.01, 1.55), respectively. For SDQ subscales, significant associations were found in regard to hyperactivity, peer relationship, and conduct problems, as well as internalizing and externalizing problems and autism screening composite scores. Cross-sectional analyses at age 7 years showed possible sex-dimorphic associations between PFAS concentrations and SDQ scores, where girls had consistently positive associations with SDQ scores whereas boys exhibited a pattern of negative or null associations. Conclusions Higher serum PFAS concentrations at ages 5- and 7-years, but not prenatally, were associated with parent-reported behavioral problems at age 7.},

  abstract = {Background: Exposure to organophosphate pesticides has been associated with neurobehavioral deficits in children, although data on low levels of exposure experienced by the general population are sparse. Pyrethroids are insecticides rapidly gaining popularity, and epidemiological evidence on their potential effects is lacking.Objective: We examined the association between exposure to organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides, indicated by urinary metabolites, and parentally reported behavioral problems in children.Methods: We used data on children 6\textendash 11 years of age from the Canadian Health Measures Survey (2007\textendash 2009). We used logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for high scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which may indicate behavioral problems, in association with concentrations of pyrethroid and organophosphate metabolites in the urine of 779 children, adjusting for covariates (sex, age, race/ethnicity, income, parental education, blood lead levels, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and others).Results: At least one urinary metabolite for organophosphates was detected in 91\% of children, and for pyrethroids in 97\% of children. Organophosphate metabolites were not significantly associated with high SDQ scores. The pyrethroid metabolite cis-DCCA [3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylycyclopropane carboxylic acid] was significantly associated with high scores for total difficulties on the SDQ (OR for a 10-fold increase = 2.0; 95\% CI: 1.1, 3.6), and there was a nonsignificant association with trans-DCCA (OR = 1.6; 95\% CI: 0.9, 3.0).Conclusion: In contrast with previous studies, we did not observe an association between exposure to organophosphate pesticides and behavioral scores in children. However, some pyrethroid urinary metabolites were associated with a high level of parent-reported behavioral problems.

During fetal life the intrauterine environment is critical for the normal development, and even small changes in the levels of hormones, such as estradiol or estrogen-mimicking chemicals, can lead to changes in brain function and consequently in behavior. We review here a series of ethological studies on the effects of maternal oral exposure during the last part of gestation (prenatal exposure) or from gestation day 11 to postnatal day 7 (perinatal exposure) to a low, environmentally relevant dose of BPA (10{$\mu$}g/kg bw/day) on behavioral responses of CD-1 mouse offspring. We examined both male and female offspring and found that maternal exposure to BPA affected: (1) behavioral responses to novelty before puberty and, as adults; (2) exploration and activity in a free-exploratory open field; (3) exploration in the elevated plus maze and (4) sensitivity to amphetamine-induced reward in the conditioned place preference test. A consistent effect of the maternal exposure to BPA is that in all these different experimental settings, while a significant sex difference was observed in the control group, exposure to BPA decreased or eliminated the sex difference in behavior. In addition, exposure of female mice to BPA in both adulthood or during fetal life altered subsequent maternal behavior. These findings, together with those from other laboratories, are evidence of long-term consequences of maternal exposure to low-dose BPA at the level of neurobehavioral development.},

  abstract = {Allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM) is well studied in imprinted domains, but this type of epigenetic asymmetry is actually found more commonly at non-imprinted loci, where the ASM is dictated not by parent-of-origin but instead by the local haplotype. We identified loci with strong ASM in human tissues from methylation-sensitive SNP array data. Two index regions (bisulfite PCR amplicons), one between the C3orf27 and RPN1 genes in chromosome band 3q21 and the other near the VTRNA2-1 vault RNA in band 5q31, proved to be new examples of imprinted DMRs (maternal alleles methylated) while a third, between STEAP3 and C2orf76 in chromosome band 2q14, showed non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM. Using long-read bisulfite sequencing (bis-seq) in 8 human tissues we found that in all 3 domains the ASM is restricted to single differentially methylated regions (DMRs), each less than 2kb. The ASM in the C3orf27-RPN1 intergenic region was placentaspecific and associated with allele-specific expression of a long non-coding RNA. Strikingly, the discrete DMRs in all 3 regions overlap with binding sites for the insulator protein CTCF, which we found selectively bound to the unmethylated allele of the STEAP3-C2orf76 DMR. Methylation mapping in two additional genes with non-imprinted haplotype-dependent ASM, ELK3 and CYP2A7, showed that the CYP2A7 DMR also overlaps a CTCF site. Thus, two features of imprinted domains, highly localized DMRs and allele-specific insulator occupancy by CTCF, can also be found in chromosomal domains with nonimprinted ASM. Arguing for biological importance, our analysis of published whole genome bis-seq data from hES cells revealed multiple genome-wide association study (GWAS) peaks near CTCF binding sites with ASM.},

  abstract = {The placenta regulates the in utero environment and functionally impacts fetal development. Candidate gene studies identified variation in placental DNA methylation is associated with newborn neurologic and behavioral outcomes including movement quality, lethargic behavior, attention, and arousal. We sought to identify novel regions of variable DNA methylation associated with newborn attention, lethargy, quality of movement, and arousal by performing an epigenome-wide association study in 335 infants from a US birth cohort. Methylation status was quantified using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array and associations to newborn outcomes assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS) were identified while incorporating established bioinformatics algorithms to control for confounding by cell type composition. Methylation of CpGs within FHIT (cg15970800) and ANKRD11 (cg16710656) demonstrated genome-wide significance (P {$<$} 1.8 \texttimes{} 10(-7)) in specific associations with infant attention. CpGs whose differential methylation was associated with all 4 neurobehavioral outcomes were common to 50 genes involved in biological processes relating to cellular adhesion and nervous system development. Comprehensive methylation profiling identified relationships between methylation of FHIT and ANKRD11, which have been previously linked to neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes in genetic association studies. Subtle changes in DNA methylation of these genes within the placenta may impact normal variation of a newborn's ability to alter and track visual and auditory stimuli. Gene ontology analysis suggested that those genes with variable methylation related to these outcomes are over-represented in biological pathways involved in brain development and placental physiology, supportive of our hypothesis for a key role of the placenta in neurobehavioral outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background: Microarray technology allows the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. This novel technique helps us to understand gene regulation as well as gene by gene interactions more systematically. In the microarray experiment, however, many undesirable systematic variations are observed. Even in replicated experiment, some variations are commonly observed. Normalization is the process of removing some sources of variation which affect the measured gene expression levels. Although a number of normalization methods have been proposed, it has been difficult to decide which methods perform best. Normalization plays an important role in the earlier stage of microarray data analysis. The subsequent analysis results are highly dependent on normalization. Results: In this paper, we use the variability among the replicated slides to compare performance of normalization methods. We also compare normalization methods with regard to bias and mean square error using simulated data. Conclusions: Our results show that intensity-dependent normalization often performs better than global normalization methods, and that linear and nonlinear normalization methods perform similarly. These conclusions are based on analysis of 36 cDNA microarrays of 3,840 genes obtained in an experiment to search for changes in gene expression profiles during neuronal differentiation of cortical stem cells. Simulation studies confirm our findings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) and other chronic diseases are caused by a complex combination of many genetic and environmental factors. Few methods are available to comprehensively associate specific physical environmental factors with disease. We conducted a pilot Environmental-Wide Association Study (EWAS), in which epidemiological data are comprehensively and systematically interpreted in a manner analogous to a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed multiple cross-sectional analyses associating 266 unique environmental factors with clinical status for T2D defined by fasting blood sugar (FBG) concentration {$>$} or =126 mg/dL. We utilized available Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohorts from years 1999 to 2006. Within cohort sample numbers ranged from 503 to 3,318. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, and an estimate of socioeconomic status (SES). As in GWAS, multiple comparisons were controlled and significant findings were validated with other cohorts. We discovered significant associations for the pesticide-derivative heptachlor epoxide (adjusted OR in three combined cohorts of 1.7 for a 1 SD change in exposure amount; p{$<$}0.001), and the vitamin gamma-tocopherol (adjusted OR 1.5; p{$<$}0.001). Higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) such as PCB170 (adjusted OR 2.2; p{$<$}0.001) were also found. Protective factors associated with T2D included beta-carotenes (adjusted OR 0.6; p{$<$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Despite difficulty in ascertaining causality, the potential for novel factors of large effect associated with T2D justify the use of EWAS to create hypotheses regarding the broad contribution of the environment to disease. Even in this study based on prior collected epidemiological measures, environmental factors can be found with effect sizes comparable to the best loci yet found by GWAS.},

  abstract = {This work tests the mode-of-action (MOA) hypothesis that maternal and developmental triclosan (TCS) exposure decreases circulating thyroxine (T4) concentrations via up-regulation of hepatic catabolism and elimination of T4. Time-pregnant Long-Evans rats received TCS po (0-300mg/kg/day) from gestational day (GD) 6 through postnatal day (PND) 21. Serum and liver were collected from dams (GD20, PND22) and offspring (GD20, PND4, PND14, PND21). Serum T4, triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Ethoxy-O-deethylase (EROD), pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase (PROD) and uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UGT) enzyme activities were measured in liver microsomes. Custom Taqman(\textregistered ) qPCR arrays were employed to measure hepatic mRNA expression of select cytochrome P450s, UGTs, sulfotransferases, transporters, and thyroid hormone-responsive genes. TCS was quantified by LC/MS/MS in serum and liver. Serum T4 decreased approximately 30\% in GD20 dams and fetuses, PND4 pups and PND22 dams (300mg/kg/day). Hepatic PROD activity increased 2-3 fold in PND4 pups and PND22 dams, and UGT activity was 1.5 fold higher in PND22 dams only (300mg/kg/day). Minor up-regulation of Cyp2b and Cyp3a expression in dams was consistent with hypothesized activation of the constitutive androstane and/or pregnane X receptor. T4 reductions of 30\% for dams and GD20 and PND4 offspring with concomitant increases in PROD (PND4 neonates and PND22 dams) and UGT activity (PND22 dams) suggest that up-regulated hepatic catabolism may contribute to TCS-induced hypothyroxinemia during development. Serum and liver TCS concentrations demonstrated greater fetal than postnatal internal exposure, consistent with the lack of T4 changes in PND14 and PND21 offspring. These data support the MOA hypothesis that TCS exposure leads to hypothyroxinemia via increased hepatic catabolism; however, the minor effects on thyroid hormone metabolism may reflect the low efficacy of TCS as thyroid hormone disruptor or highlight the possibility that other MOAs may also contribute to the observed maternal and early neonatal hypothyroxinemia.},

  abstract = {Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical epidemiological research. Individuals with missing data may differ from those with no missing data in terms of the outcome of interest and prognosis in general. Missing data are often categorized into the following three types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). In clinical epidemiological research, missing data are seldom MCAR. Missing data can constitute considerable challenges in the analyses and interpretation of results and can potentially weaken the validity of results and conclusions. A number of methods have been developed for dealing with missing data. These include complete-case analyses, missing indicator method, single value imputation, and sensitivity analyses incorporating worst-case and best-case scenarios. If applied under the MCAR assumption, some of these methods can provide unbiased but often less precise estimates. Multiple imputation is an alternative method to deal with missing data, which accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data. Multiple imputation is implemented in most statistical software under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased and valid estimates of associations based on information from the available data. The method affects not only the coefficient estimates for variables with missing data but also the estimates for other variables with no missing data.},

  abstract = {In the past few decades, the placenta became a very controversial topic that has had many researchers and pharmacists discussing the significance of the effects of pharmaceutical drug intake and how it is a possible leading cause towards birth defects. The creation of an in vitro microengineered model of the placenta can be used to replicate the interactions between the mother and fetus, specifically pharmaceutical drug intake reactions. As the field of nanotechnology significantly continues growing, nanotechnology will become more apparent in the study of medicine and other scientific disciplines, specifically microengineering applications. This review is based on past and current research that compares the feasibility and testing of the placenta-on-a-chip microengineered model to the previous and underdeveloped in vivo and ex vivo approaches. The testing of the practicality and effectiveness of the in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo models requires the experimentation of prominent pharmaceutical drugs that most mothers consume during pregnancy. In this case, these drugs need to be studied and tested more often. However, there are challenges associated with the in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo processes when developing a practical placental model, which are discussed in further detail.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phthalates, used in a variety of consumer products, are a group of chemicals that are ubiquitous in the environment, and their metabolites are detectable in most humans. Some phthalates have anti-androgenic properties; a prior study reported an association between gestational exposure to phthalates and reduced masculine behaviors in preschool boys. METHODS: Concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites were measured in urine collected at 16 and 26~weeks' gestation from pregnant women enrolled in the HOME Study, a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort. Measures of gender-related play were collected at 8~years of age, including the Gender Identity Questionnaire (GIQ) completed by mothers, and the Playmate and Play Style Preferences Structured Interview (PPPSI) completed by children. We examined these measures as continuous variables using both bivariate and multivariable approaches with adjustment for covariates. Additional analyses included logistic regression of GIQ and PPPSI scores dichotomized by sex at the lower 25th percentile, indicating the least typical behavior. RESULTS: Mothers' phthalate metabolite concentrations during pregnancy were similar to the reported national average among US women. All children scored within a typical range on both measures of gender-related play behavior. No statistically significant associations were found between averaged maternal phthalate metabolite concentrations and continuous PPPSI scores or any GIQ scores. For the dichotomized PPPSI; higher maternal monoethyl phthalate (MEP) concentrations were associated with more typical play behaviors for females (OR\,=\,0.70, CI\,=\,0.51-0.97). In contrast, higher maternal mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) concentrations were associated with higher odds of membership in the least typical play behaviors group for males (OR\,=\,1.69, CI\,=\,1.00-2.86). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of typically developing children, higher maternal urinary MEP concentrations during pregnancy were associated with more typical gender-related play behaviors in both males and females, and increased urinary MiBP concentrations were associated with less masculine gender-related play behaviors in males.},

The data reviewed here on environmental contaminants have potential implications for risk assessment although more data are needed on individual susceptibility to epigenetic alterations and their persistence before this information can be used in formal risk assessments. The findings discussed indicate that identification of environmental chemicals that dysregulate the prenatal epigenome should be a priority in health research and disease prevention.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental laboratory evidence suggests that bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is a neurodevelopmental toxicant. However, there have been limited and inconclusive results with respect to sex-specific BPA effects on child behavior. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between prenatal BPA exposure and child behavior, adjusting for postnatal BPA exposure and hypothesizing sex-specific effects. METHODS: We followed African-American and Dominican women and their children from pregnancy to child's age 5 years, collecting spot urine samples from the mothers during pregnancy (34 weeks on average) and from children between 3 and 4 years of age to estimate BPA exposure. We assessed child behavior between 3 and 5 years of age using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and used generalized linear models to test the association between BPA exposure and child behavior, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: The analysis was conducted on 198 children (87 boys and 111 girls). Among boys, high prenatal BPA exposure (highest quartile vs. the lowest three quartiles) was associated with significantly higher CBCL scores (more problems) on Emotionally Reactive [1.62 times greater; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.13, 2.32] and Aggressive Behavior syndromes (1.29 times greater; 95\% CI: 1.09, 1.53). Among girls, higher exposure was associated with lower scores on all syndromes, reaching statistical significance for Anxious/Depressed (0.75 times as high; 95\% CI: 0.57, 0.99) and Aggressive Behavior (0.82 times as high; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.97). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA may affect child behavior, and differently among boys and girls.},

We previously reported that a broad spectrum of combustion-related DNA adducts in cord blood was associated with attention problems at 6-7 years of age in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) longitudinal cohort study. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the relationship between behavioral problems and two different measures of prenatal exposure--both specific to PAH--in the same cohort. METHODS: Children of nonsmoking African-American and Dominican women in New York City (NYC) were followed from in utero to 6-7 years. Prenatal PAH exposure was estimated by personal air monitoring of the mothers during pregnancy as well as by the measurement of DNA adducts specific to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a representative PAH, in maternal and cord blood. At 6-7 years of age, child behavior was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (n = 253). Generalized linear models were used to test the association between prenatal PAH exposure and behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, high prenatal PAH exposure, whether characterized by personal air monitoring (greater than the median of 2.27 ng/m{$^3$}) or maternal and cord adducts (detectable or higher), was positively associated with symptoms of Anxious/Depressed and Attention Problems (p {$\leq$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results provide additional evidence that environmental levels of PAH encountered in NYC air can adversely affect child behavior.},

We previously reported a positive association between prenatal BPA exposure and symptoms of anxiety/depression reported by the mother at child age 7-9 years in boys, but not girls. OBJECTIVES: Here, in the same birth cohort, we investigated the association of prenatal BPA exposure with symptoms of depression and anxiety self-reported by the 10-12 year olds, hypothesizing that we would observe sex-specific differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms. METHODS: African-American and Dominican women living in Northern Manhattan and their children were followed from mother's pregnancy through children's age 10-12 years. BPA was quantified in maternal urine collected during the third trimester of pregnancy and in child urine collected at ages 3 and 5 years. Children were evaluated using the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) and Children's Depression Rating Scale (CDRS). We compared the children in the highest tertile of BPA concentration to those in the lower two tertiles. Associations between behavior and prenatal (maternal) BPA concentration or postnatal (child) BPA concentration were assessed in regression models stratified by sex. RESULTS: Significant positive associations between prenatal BPA and symptoms of depression and anxiety were observed among boys. Postnatal BPA exposure was not significantly associated with outcomes. There was substantial co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in this sample. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that prenatal BPA exposure is associated with more symptoms of anxiety and depression in boys but not in girls at age 10-12 years.},

This work investigates the comparative toxicity and ability to interfere with the synthesis of steroids and to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) of a selected number of plasticizers, including bisphenol A (BPA), nonyl- (NP) and octylphenol (OP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP), in the human placenta JEG-3 cells.

After 24h exposure, OP and NP showed the highest cytotoxicity (EC50: 36\textendash 40{$\mu$}M) followed by BPA (138\textendash 219{$\mu$}M), whereas no significant toxicity was observed for phthalates. Notwithstanding, BBP and DBP significantly decreased P450 aromatase activity (experimental IC50: 14\textendash 15{$\mu$}M), while NP and OP (20{$\mu$}M) increased the activity. Overall, this study evidences the differential toxicity and ability to modulate placental aromatase activity of some of the compounds nowadays used as plasticizers, and highlights the need of an accurate determination of the bioavailability of chemicals to improve the sensitivity of in-vitro tests.},

The objective is to characterize the ability of within-subject pooling of biospecimens to reduce bias due to exposure misclassification when within-subject variability in biomarker concentrations is high. Methods: We considered chemicals with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.6 and 0.2. In a simulation study, we hypothesized that the chemical urinary concentrations averaged over a given time period were associated with a health outcome and estimated the bias of studies assessing exposure that collected 1 to 50 random biospecimens per subject. We assumed a classical type error. We studied associations using a within-subject pooling approach and two measurement error models (simulation extrapolation and regression calibration), the latter requiring the assay of more than one biospecimen per subject. Results: For both continuous and binary outcomes, using one sample led to attenuation bias of 40\% and 80\% for compounds with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.6 and 0.2, respectively. For a compound with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.6, the numbers of biospecimens required to limit bias to less than 10\% were 6, 2, and 2 biospecimens with the pooling, simulation extrapolation, and regression calibration methods (these values were, respectively, 35, 8, and 2 for a compound with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.2). Compared with pooling, these methods did not improve power. Conclusion: Within-subject pooling limits attenuation bias without increasing assay costs. Simulation extrapolation and regression},

This study aimed to determine the associations of trace elements with lipid profiles and glycaemic control in patients with T1DM. A total of 192 patients with T1DM who attended the Unit of Diabetology and Metabolic Diseases in Sassari, Italy, were enrolled. Trace elements zinc, copper, selenium, chromium, and iron were measured in whole blood by sector field inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The correlations between metabolic variables and the levels of trace elements were determined. Zinc was positively correlated with total cholesterol (P=0.023), low-density lipoprotein (P=0.0015), and triglycerides (P=0.027). Iron as significantly correlated with TC (P=0.0189), LDL (P=0.0121), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (P=0.0466). In males, Cr was positively correlated with HDL (P=0.0079) and Se, in females was correlated with TG (P=0.0113). The mean fasting plasma glucose was166.2mgdL(-1). Chromium was correlated with fasting plasma glucose (P=0.0149), particularly in males (P=0.0038). Overall, 63.5\% of the patients had moderate HbA1c (7-9\%). Copper was significantly correlated with HbA1c\% in males (P=0.0155). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that trace elements show different associations with lipid levels and glycaemic control in T1DM. Zinc, Fe, and Se were associated with lipid levels whereas Cu and Cr were associated with HbA1c\%.},

  abstract = {Background: The identification and characterisation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between phenotypes in the human genome is of prime interest in epigenetics. We present a novel method, DMRcate, that fits replicated methylation measurements from the Illumina HM450K BeadChip (or 450K array) spatially across the genome using a Gaussian kernel. DMRcate identifies and ranks the most differentially methylated regions across the genome based on tunable kernel smoothing of the differential methylation (DM) signal. The method is agnostic to both genomic annotation and local change in the direction of the DM signal, removes the bias incurred from irregularly spaced methylation sites, and assigns significance to each DMR called via comparison to a null model. Results: We show that, for both simulated and real data, the predictive performance of DMRcate is superior to those of Bumphunter and Probe Lasso, and commensurate with that of comb-p. For the real data, we validate all array-derived DMRs from the candidate methods on a suite of DMRs derived from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing called from the same DNA samples, using two separate phenotype comparisons. Conclusions: The agglomeration of genomically localised individual methylation sites into discrete DMRs is currently best served by a combination of DM-signal smoothing and subsequent threshold specification. The findings also suggest the design of the 450K array shows preference for CpG sites that are more likely to be differentially methylated, but its overall coverage does not adequately reflect the depth and complexity of methylation signatures afforded by sequencing. For the convenience of the research community we have created a user-friendly R software package called DMRcate, downloadable from Bioconductor and compatible with existing preprocessing packages, which allows others to apply the same DMR-finding method on 450K array data.},

  abstract = {Background: Maternal urinary biomarkers are often used to assess fetal exposure to phenols and their precursors. Their effectiveness as a measure of exposure in epidemiological studies depends on their variability during pregnancy and their ability to accurately predict fetal exposure. Objectives: We assessed the relationship between urinary and amniotic fluid concentrations of nine environmental phenols, and the reproducibility of urinary concentrations, among pregnant women. Methods: Seventy-one women referred for amniocentesis were included. Maternal urine was collected at the time of the amniocentesis appointment and on two subsequent occasions. Urine and amniotic fluid were analyzed for 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenols, bisphenol A, benzophenone-3, triclosan, and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparabens using online solid phase extraction\textendash high performance liquid chromatography\textendash isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Only benzophenone-3 and propylparaben were detectable in more than half of the amniotic fluid samples; for these phenols, concentrations in amniotic fluid and maternal urine collected on the same day were positively correlated ({$\rho$} = 0.53 and 0.32, respectively). Other phenols were detected infrequently in amniotic fluid (e.g., bisphenol A was detected in only two samples). The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of urinary concentrations in samples from individual women ranged from 0.48 to 0.62 for all phenols except bisphenol A (ICC = 0.11). Conclusion: Amniotic fluid detection frequencies for most phenols were low. The reproducibility of urine measures was poor for bisphenol A, but good for the other phenols. Although a single sample may provide a reasonable estimate of exposure for some phenols, collecting multiple urine samples during pregnancy is an option to reduce exposure measurement error in studies regarding the effects of phenol prenatal exposure on health.},

Methods Within a cohort of women recruited during pregnancy, we selected 520 mother\textendash son pairs and quantified 9 phenols in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy. We used ultrasonography during pregnancy, together with birth measurements, to assess fetal growth. We modeled individual postnatal growth trajectories from repeated measures of weight and height in the first 3 years of life. Results Triclosan concentration was negatively associated with growth parameters measured at the third ultrasound examination but not earlier in pregnancy. At birth, this phenol tended to be negatively associated with head circumference (-1.2 mm for an interquartile range [IQR] increase in ln-transformed triclosan concentration [95\% confidence interval = -2.6 to 0.3]) but not with weight or height. Parabens were positively associated with weight at birth. This positive association remained for 3 years for methylparaben ({$\beta$} = 193 g [-4 to 389]) for an IQR increase in ln-transformed concentrations. Conclusion We relied on only 1 spot urine sample to assess exposure; because of the high variability in phenol urinary concentrations reported during pregnancy, using only 1 sample may result in exposure misclassification, in particular for bisphenol A. Our study suggested associations between prenatal exposure to parabens and triclosan and prenatal or early postnatal growth.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Organophosphates are widely used pesticides that have been shown to affect child neurodevelopment. Previous studies that explored their potential effects on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relied either on proxies of external exposure or on questionnaires completed by the parents to identify autism-like behaviors but did not provide a clinical diagnosis of ASD. AIMS: We studied the associations between prenatal biologic markers for exposure to organophosphate pesticides and the risk of having a child with ASD or other developmental concerns (ODC). METHOD: We analyzed 203 mother-child pairs of the ongoing MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies - Learning Early Signs) mother-child cohort, which enrolls mothers who are either pregnant or planning a pregnancy and whose expected child has an elevated risk to develop ASD. Seven metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were assessed in repeated urine samples collected during pregnancy. At 36 months, children were assessed with intruments measuring cognitive function and adaptive behaviors, and with two gold-standard diagnostic instruments for ASD: the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Children were classified in one of the following groups: ASD (n = 46), ODC (n = 55) and typically developing (TD, n = 102). RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, organophosphate metabolite concentrations were not associated with an increased risk of ASD or ODC when boys and girls were studied together. After stratification by sex, dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP) pregnancy concentration tended to be associated with an increased ASD risk among girls (OR for a doubling in the DMTP concentration: 1.64 (95\%CI, 0.95; 2.82)) but not among boys (OR: 0.84, 95\%CI: 0.63; 1.11). DISCUSSION: This is the first study of clinically confirmed diagnoses of ASD that utilized repeated measurements of organophosphate metabolites during pregnancy to explore the associations between these pesticides and ASD risk in children. The association we observed among girls, as well as the lack of association in boys, need to be replicated in further studies with similar design and larger sample size. In light of the higher baseline risk for ASD in this cohort, generalizability to children lacking a first degree relative affected by ASD is unknown.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The placenta performs crucial physiological functions to ensure normal fetal development. Few epidemiological studies investigated placental weight sensitivity to phthalates and phenols. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to explore whether maternal exposure to select phthalates and phenols is associated with changes in placental weight at birth and in placental\textendash to\textendash birth weight ratio (PFR). METHODS: Placental weight and birth weight were available for 473 mother\textendash son pairs in the EDEN (Etude des D\'eterminants pr\'e et postnatals du d\'eveloppement et de la sant\'e de l'Enfant) cohort for whom 9 phenols (4 parabens, 2 dichlorophenols, triclosan, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A) and 11 phthalate metabolites were measured in spot urine samples collected between weeks 23 and 29 of gestation. We used adjusted Elastic Net penalized regression models (ENET) to select biomarkers associated with placental weight, birth weight and PFR. Unpenalized effect estimates were then obtained by fitting linear regression models simultaneously adjusted for the ENET-selected biomarkers and a priori chosen confounders. RESULTS: The multipollutant ENET model for placental weight retained four biomarkers: triclosan and monocarboxy-isononyl phthalate (MCNP), which were negatively associated with placental weight, and benzophenone-3 and the sum of parabens, which were positively associated with this outcome. The ENET model for PFR retained two phthalate metabolites [MCNP and monocarboxy-isooctyl phthalate (MCOP)], which were negatively associated with this outcome. DISCUSSION: The positive association between the sum of parabens and placental weight was consistent with results of a previous study among 49 male births. Our results provide preliminary evidence of possible associations between other compounds such as triclosan, benzophenone-3, MCNP, and MCOP and both placental weight and PFR. These associations were not reported in previous studies and should be seen as hypothesis generating. Studies relying on repeated assessments of exposure in prospective mother\textendash child cohorts are needed to substantiate the plausibility of the hypotheses generated by our results. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3523.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic imprinting, mediated by parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic silencing, adjusts the gene expression dosage in mammals. We aimed to clarify parental allelic expression in the human placenta for 396 claimed candidate imprinted genes and to assess the evidence for the proposed enrichment of imprinted expression in the placenta. The study utilized RNA-Seq-based transcriptome and genotyping data from 54 parental-placental samples representing the three trimesters of gestation, and term cases of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and fetal growth disturbances. RESULTS: Almost half of the targeted genes (n = 179; 45\%) were either not transcribed or showed limited expression in the human placenta. After filtering for the presence of common exonic SNPs, adequacy of sequencing reads and informative families, 91 genes were retained (43 loci form Geneimprint database; 48 recently proposed genes). Only 11/91 genes (12.1\%) showed confident signals of imprinting (binomial test, Bonferroni corrected P {$<$} 0.05; {$>$}\,90\% transcripts originating from one parental allele). The confirmed imprinted genes exhibit enriched placental expression (PHLDA2, H19, IGF2, MEST, ZFAT, PLAGL1, AIM1) or are transcribed additionally only in the adrenal gland (MEG3, RTL1, PEG10, DLK1). Parental monoallelic expression showed extreme stability across gestation and in term pregnancy complications. A distinct group of additional 14 genes exhibited a statistically significant bias in parental allelic proportions defined as having 65-90\% of reads from one parental allele (e.g., KLHDC10, NLRP2, RHOBTB3, DNMT1). Molecular mechanisms behind biased parental expression are still to be clarified. However, 66 of 91 (72.5\%) analyzed candidate imprinted genes showed no signals of deviation from biallelic expression. CONCLUSIONS: As placental tissue is not included in The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, the study contributed to fill the gap in the knowledge concerning parental allelic expression. A catalog of parental allelic proportions and gene expression of analyzed loci across human gestation and in term pregnancy complications is provided as additional files. The study outcome suggested that true imprinting in the human placenta is restricted to well-characterized loci. High expression of imprinted genes during mid-pregnancy supports their critical role in developmental programming. Consistent with the data on other GTEx tissues, the number of human imprinted genes appears to be overestimated.},

The placenta is a complex heterogeneous organ including cells of both maternal and fetal origin, and insults that disrupt the maternal-fetal dialogue could result in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. There is limited knowledge of the cell type composition and transcriptional activity of the placenta and its compartments during physiologic and pathologic parturition. To fill this knowledge gap, we used scRNA-seq to profile the placental villous tree, basal plate, and chorioamniotic membranes of women with or without labor at term and those with preterm labor. Significant differences in cell type composition and transcriptional profiles were found among placental compartments and across study groups. For the first time, two cell types were identified: 1) lymphatic endothelial decidual cells in the chorioamniotic membranes, and 2) non-proliferative interstitial cytotrophoblasts in the placental villi. Maternal macrophages from the chorioamniotic membranes displayed the largest differences in gene expression (e.g. NFKB1) in both processes of labor; yet, specific gene expression changes were also detected in preterm labor. Importantly, several placental scRNA-seq transcriptional signatures were modulated with advancing gestation in the maternal circulation, and specific immune cell type signatures were increased with labor at term (NK-cell and activated T-cell signatures) and with preterm labor (macrophage, monocyte, and activated T-cell signatures). Herein, we provide a catalogue of cell types and transcriptional profiles in the human placenta, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings and non-invasive prediction of the physiologic and pathologic parturition.},

To accomplish these numerous functions, the placenta depends on a highly efficient energy metabolism control. Recent studies showed that the orphan nuclear receptor Estrogen-Related Receptor gamma (ERR{$\gamma$}) is highly expressed in human placentas. As ERR{$\gamma$} has been described as a major energy metabolism regulator, we investigated ERR{$\gamma$} expression and putative roles on energy homeostasis in human trophoblast from first trimester placentas. First, we showed that ERR{$\gamma$} expression level increased during pregnancy and that ERR{$\gamma$} was more abundant in villous than in extravillous trophoblasts. We also observed that ERR{$\gamma$} expression increased during trophoblast differentiation. Second, we demonstrated that mitochondrial biogenesis and expression of some energy metabolism target genes decreased when ERR{$\gamma$} expression was impaired. Altogether, these results suggest that ERR{$\gamma$} could be implicated in the energy metabolism regulation of human trophoblasts.},

The modern environment is replete with man-made compounds such as plastic product chemicals (PPC), including phenols and phthalates. Evidence from several human cohorts implicates exposure to these chemicals in adverse offspring neurodevelopment, though a direct causal relationship has not been firmly established. In this review we consider a potential causal pathway that encompasses epigenetic human variation, and how we might test this mechanistic hypothesis in human studies. In the first part of this report we outline how PPCs induce epigenetic change, focusing on the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, a key regulator of neurodevelopment. Further, we discuss the role of the epigenetics of BDNF and other genes in neurodevelopment and the emerging human evidence of an association between phthalate exposure and adverse offspring neurodevelopment. We discuss aspects of epidemiological and molecular study design and analysis that could be employed to strengthen the level of human evidence to infer causality. We undertake this using an exemplar recent research example: maternal prenatal smoking, linked to methylation change at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene at birth, now shown to mediate some of the effects of maternal smoking on birth weight. Characterizing the relationship between the modern environment and the human molecular pathways underpinning its impact on early development is paramount to understanding the public health significance of modern day chemical exposures.},

The method was developed for simultaneous determination of twenty-five PFASs, including polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs; 6:2, 8:2, 6:2/6:2, and 8:2/8:2), perfluoroalkyl phosphonates (PFPAs; C6, C8, and C10), perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs; C4, C6, C7, C8, and C10), perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; C5C14), and perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides (FOSAs; C8, N-methyl, and N-ethyl). High linearity of matrix-matched calibration standards (correlation coefficients, R~=~0.99-0.999) were obtained in the range of 0.006-45~ng~mL-1 blood. Excellent sensitivity was achieved with method detection limits (MDLs) between 0.0018 and 0.09~ng~mL-1, depending on the compound and matrix. The method was validated for serum, plasma, and whole blood (n~=~5~+~5) at six levels in the range 0.0180-30~ng~mL-1. The accuracy (n~=~5) was on average 102{$\pm~$}12\%. The intermediate precision (n~=~10) ranged from 2 to 40\% with an average between-batch of analyses difference of 10{$\pm~$}10\%.

The aim of this study is to understand DNA methylation patterns across different stages of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Results Our study identified 72, 93 and 170 significant DNA methylated genes in Stages I, II and III respectively. A set of common 34 significant DNA methylated genes located in the promoter section of the true CpG islands were found across stages, and these were: HOX genes, FOXG1, GRIK3, HAND2, PRKCB, etc. Of the total significant DNA methylated genes, 65 correlated with transcription function. The epigenetic analysis identified the following novel genes across all stages: PTGDR, TLX3, and POU4F2. The stage-wise analysis observed the appearance of NEUROG1 gene in Stage I and its re-appearance in Stage III. The analysis showed similar epigenetic pattern across Stage I and Stage III. Pathway analysis revealed important signaling and metabolic pathways of LUAD to correlate with epigenetics. Epigenetic subnetwork analysis identified a set of seven conserved genes across all stages: UBC, KRAS, PIK3CA, PIK3R3, RAF1, BRAF, and RAP1A. A detailed literature analysis elucidated epigenetic genes like FOXG1, HLA-G, and NKX6-2 to be known as prognostic targets. Conclusion Integrating epigenetic information for genes with expression data can be useful for comprehending in-depth disease mechanism and for the ultimate goal of better target identification.},

  abstract = {It is well known, but frequently overlooked, that low- and high-throughput molecular data may contain batch effects, i.e., systematic technical variation. Confounding of experimental batches with the variable(s) of interest is especially concerning, as a batch effect may then be interpreted as a biologically significant finding. An integral step towards reducing false discovery in molecular data analysis includes inspection for batch effects and accounting for this signal if present. In a 30-sample pilot Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450k array) experiment, we identified two sources of batch effects: array row and chip. Here, we demonstrate two approaches taken to process the 450k data in which an R function, ComBat, was applied to adjust for the non-biological signal. In the ``initial analysis'', the application of ComBat to an unbalanced study design resulted in 9,612 and 19,214 significant (FDR{$<$}0.05) DNA methylation differences, despite none present prior to correction. Suspicious of this dramatic change, a ``revised processing'' included changes to our analysis as well as a greater number of samples, and successfully reduced batch effects without introducing false signal. Our work supports conclusions made by an article previously published in this journal: though the ultimate antidote to batch effects is thoughtful study design, every DNA methylation microarray analysis should inspect, assess and, if necessary, account for batch effects. The analysis experience presented here can serve as a reminder to the broader community to establish research questions a priori, ensure that they match with study design and encourage communication between technicians and analysts.},

The aetiology of SRS is complex and current evidence strongly implicates imprinted genes. Approximately half of all patients exhibit DNA hypomethylation at the H19/IGF2 imprinted domain, and around 10\% have maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7. We measured DNA methylation in 18 SRS patients at {$>$}485,000 CpG sites using DNA methylation microarrays. Using a novel bioinformatics methodology specifically designed to identify subsets of patients with a shared epimutation, we analysed methylation changes genome-wide as well as at known imprinted regions to identify SRS-associated epimutations. Our analysis identifies epimutations at the previously characterised domains of H19/IGF2 and at imprinted regions on chromosome 7, providing proof of principle that our methodology can detect DNA methylation changes at imprinted loci. In addition we discovered two novel epimutations associated with SRS and located at imprinted loci previously linked to relevant mouse and human phenotypes. We identify RB1 as an additional imprinted locus associated with SRS, with a region near the RB1 DMR hypermethylated in 13/18 (\textasciitilde 70 \%) patients. We also report 6/18 (\textasciitilde 33 \%) patients were hypermethylated at a CpG island near the ANKRD11 gene. We do not observe consistent cooccurrence of epimutations at multiple imprinted loci in single SRS individuals. SRS is clinically heterogeneous and the absence of multiple imprinted loci epimutations reflects the heterogeneity at the molecular level. Further stratification of SRS patients by molecular phenotypes might aid the identification of disease causes.},

Child behavior was assessed by parent and teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Teacher Report Form, respectively. Results The mean(SD) total GWG(kg) was 14.5(5.9), and 10\% of women had a pregravid BMI {$\geq$}30.

  abstract = {Pseudohypoparathyroid patients have resistance predominantly to parathyroid hormone (PTH), and here we have examined the ability of an alternative G{$\alpha$}s-related protein to inhibit G{$\alpha$}s activity in a hormone-selective manner. We tested whether the G/VAS exon A/B-derived NH2-terminally truncated (Tr) {$\alpha$}s protein alters stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the PTH receptor (PTHR1), the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor (TSHR), the {$\beta$}2-adrenergic receptor ({$\beta$}2AR), or the AVP receptor (V2R). HEK293 cells cotransfected with receptor and full-length (FL) G{$\alpha$}s{$\pm$}Tr {$\pm$}s protein expression vectors were stimulated with agonists (PTH [10-7 to 10-9 M], TSH [1 to 100 mU], isoproterenol [10-6 to 10-8M], or AVP [10-6 to 10-8M]). Following PTH stimulation, HEK293 cells cotransfected with PTHR1 + FL G{$\alpha$}s + Tr {$\alpha$}s had a significantly lower cAMP response than those transfected with only PTHR1 + FL G{$\alpha$}s. Tr {$\alpha$}s also exerted an inhibitory effect on the cAMP levels stimulated by TSH via the TSHR but had little or no effect on isoproterenol or AVP acting via {$\beta$}2AR or V2R, respectively. These differences mimic the spectrum of hormone resistance in pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a (PHP-1a) and type 1b (PHP-1b) patients. In opossum kidney (OK) cells, endogenously expressing the PTHR1 and {$\beta$}2AR, the exogenous expression of Tr {$\alpha$}s at a level similar to endogenous FL G{$\alpha$}s resulted in blunting of the cAMP response to PTH, whereas that to isoproterenol was unaltered. A pseudopseudohypoparathyroid patient with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy harbored a de novo paternally inherited M1l G{$\alpha$}s mutation. Similar maternally inherited mutations at the initiation codon have been identified previously in PHP-1a patients. The M1l {$\alpha$}s mutant (lacking the first 59 amino acids of G{$\alpha$}s) blunted the increase in cAMP levels stimulated via the PTHR1 in both HEK293 and OK cells similar to the Tr {$\alpha$}s protein. Thus NH2-terminally truncated forms of G{$\alpha$}s may contribute to the pathogenesis of pseudohypoparathyroidism by inhibiting the activity of G{$\alpha$}s itself in a GPCR selective manner.},

  abstract = {, Triclosan (TCS) and triclocarban (TCC) are antimicrobial agents formulated in a wide variety of consumer products (including soaps, toothpaste, medical devices, plastics, and fabrics) that are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In late 2014, the FDA will consider regulating the use of both chemicals, which are under scrutiny regarding lack of effectiveness, potential for endocrine disruption, and potential contribution to bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Here, we report on body burdens of TCS and TCC resulting from real-world exposures during pregnancy. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we determined the concentrations of TCS, TCC, and its human metabolites (2{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC and 3{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC) as well as the manufacturing byproduct (3{${'}$}-chloro-TCC) as total concentrations ({$\Sigma-$}) after conjugate hydrolysis in maternal urine and cord blood plasma from a cohort of 181 expecting mother/infant pairs in an urban multiethnic population from Brooklyn, NY recruited in 2007\textendash 09. TCS was detected in 100\% of urine and 51\% of cord blood samples after conjugate hydrolysis. The interquartile range (IQR) of detected TCS concentrations in urine was highly similar to the IQR reported previously for the age-matched population of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2004, but typically higher than the IQR reported previously for the general population (detection frequency = 74.6\%). Urinary levels of TCC are reported here for the first time from real-world exposures during pregnancy, showing a median concentration of 0.21 {$\mu$}g/L. Urinary concentrations of TCC correlated well with its phase-I metabolite {$\sum$}-2{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC (r = 0.49) and the manufacturing byproduct {$\sum$}-3{${'}$}-chloro-TCC C (r = 0.79), and {$\sum$}-2{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC correlated strongly with {$\sum$}-3{${'}$}-hydroxy-TCC (r = 0.99). This human biomonitoring study presents the first body burden data for TCC from exposures occurring during pregnancy and provides additional data on composite exposure to TCS (i.e., from both consumer-product use and environmental sources) in the maternal\textendash fetal unit for an urban population in the United States.},

  abstract = {Background: In recent years, prevalence rates of behavioral disorders in children have increased. One factor possibly implied in the etiology of behavioral disorders is exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). The use of PFASs is highly integrated into everyday life, and exposure is ubiquitous. Exposure to PFASs during early life may be particularly harmful, as it represents a critical time window for brain development. However, research in the area is limited, especially among preschool children. The objective of the current study was to explore the relationship between prenatal exposure to several PFASs and behavioral development at the age of 18 months. Methods: Data from the Dutch cohort LINC (Linking Maternal Nutrition to Child Health) were used. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were measured in cord plasma. The total exposure of PFASs was also calculated ({$\Sigma$}PFASs). Behavioral development was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5\textendash 5 (CBCL 1.5\textendash 5). The CBCL scales ``Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder'' (ADHD) and ``Externalizing problems'' were used for further analysis. Separate regression models were composed for each combination, in which exposure levels were classified in tertiles. Both whole population and sex-stratified analyses were performed. A family history of ADHD, the educational level, smoking or using alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy were considered as confounders. In total, data from 76 mother-child pairs was included. Results: No significant associations were found between prenatal PFAS exposure and ADHD scores in the whole population and in the sex-stratified analyses. With regard to externalizing behavior, a significant negative association was found between the highest levels of {$\Sigma$}PFAS exposure and externalizing problem behavior in the whole population, but only in the crude model. After stratifying for sex, boys in the second and third tertile of exposure to PFOA presented significantly lower scores on the Externalizing Problem Scale than boys with the lowest exposure levels in the adjusted model. Girls exposed to higher levels of {$\Sigma$}PFAS exposure (T2) showed significantly lower scores on the Externalizing Problem Scale, in both crude and adjusted models. No significant associations with PFOS were found. Conclusions: Results from the current study show that prenatal exposure to PFOA was negatively related to externalizing behavior in boys. Results were different for boys and girls, emphasizing that mechanisms at work might be sex-dependent. However, results should be interpreted with caution as the sample size was small.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The function of Kv4.3 (KCND3) channels, which underlie the transient outward current I(to) in human heart, can be modulated by several accessory subunits such as KChIP2 and KCNE1-KCNE5. Here we aimed to determine the regional expression of Kv4.3, KChIP2, and KCNE mRNAs in non-failing and failing human hearts and to investigate the functional consequences of subunit coexpression in heterologous expression systems. METHODS: We quantified mRNA levels for two Kv4.3 isoforms, Kv4.3-S and Kv4.3-L, and for KChIP2 as well as KCNE1-KCNE5 with real-time RT-PCR. We also studied the effects of KCNEs on Kv4.3+KChIP2 current characteristics in CHO cells with the whole-cell voltage-clamp method. RESULTS: In non-failing hearts, low expression was found for KCNE1, KCNE3, and KCNE5, three times higher expression for KCNE2, and 60 times higher for KCNE4. Transmural gradients were detected only for KChIP2 in left and right ventricles. Compared to non-failing tissue, failing hearts showed higher expression of Kv4.3-L and KCNE1 and lower of Kv4.3-S, KChIP2, KCNE4, and KCNE5. In CHO cells, Kv4.3+KChIP2 currents were differentially modified by co-expressed KCNEs: time constants of inactivation were shorter with KCNE1 and KCNE3-5 while time-to-peak was decreased, and V(0.5) of steady-state inactivation was shifted to more negative potentials by all KCNE subunits. Importantly, KCNE2 induced a unique and prominent 'overshoot' of peak current during recovery from inactivation similar to that described for human I(to) while other KCNE subunits induced little (KCNE4,5) or no overshoot. CONCLUSIONS: All KCNEs are expressed in the human heart at the transcript level. Compared to I(to) in native human myocytes, none of the combination of KChIP2 and KCNE produced an ideal congruency in current characteristics, suggesting that additional factors contribute to the regulation of the native I(to) channel.},

Paternally expressed, growth promoting genes (SNRPN, PEG10 and MEST) which are known to play crucial role in tumorogenesis, are not well studied during placentation. This study reports for the first time of the impact of gestational-age, pathological conditions and folic acid supplementation on dynamic nature of DNA and histone methylation present at their differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Here, we reported the association between low DNA methylation/H3K27me3 and higher expression of SNRPN, PEG10 and MEST in highly proliferating normal early gestational placenta. Molar and preeclamptic placental villi, exhibited aberrant changes in methylation levels at DMRs of these genes, leading to higher and lower expression of these genes, respectively, in reference to their respective control groups. Moreover, folate supplementation could induce gene specific changes in mRNA expression in placental cell lines. Further, MEST and SNRPN DMRs were observed to show the potential to act as novel fetal DNA markers in maternal plasma. Thus, variation in methylation levels at these DMRs regulate normal placentation and placental disorders. Additionally, the methylation at these DMRs might also be susceptible to folic acid supplementation and has the potential to be utilized in clinical diagnosis.},

Like Kaiser's rule, this test is one of the most frequently used strategies for determining the number of components to retain. However, the graphical nature of the scree test does not definitively establish the number of components to retain. To circumvent this issue, some numerical solutions are proposed, one in the spirit of Cattell's work and dealing with the scree part of the eigenvalues plot, and one focusing on the elbow part of this plot. A simulation study compares the efficiency of these solutions to those of other previously proposed methods. Extensions to factor analysis are possible and may be particularly useful with many low-dimensional components.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the concentrations of total mercury (T-Hg) in cord blood and to evaluate the role of maternal fish consumption in a Spanish mother and child cohort. METHODS: A total of 1883 mother and child pairs from a population-based cohort were included between 2004 and 2008. T-Hg concentrations were measured in whole cord blood and maternal seafood consumption was ascertained by means of a food-frequency questionnaire. Linear regression was used in stratified analyses, while a joint model was adjusted using a mixed-effects linear model. RESULTS: Maternal daily seafood consumption was 78g/d and the geometric mean for T-Hg was 8.2{$\mu$}g/L. Maternal fish intake during pregnancy, mother's age, country of origin, educational level, employment status and parity, as well as area of study and season of delivery, were associated with cord blood T-Hg levels. A doubling in consumption of large oily fish was associated with an increase of 11.4\% (95\%CI: 3.8 to 19.6\%) in cord blood T-Hg levels, followed by an increase of 8.4\% (95\%CI: 5.7 to 11.2\%) in the case of canned tuna and 8.3\% (95\%CI: 5.5 to 11.1\%) in that of lean fish. CONCLUSION: A high proportion of newborns had elevated concentrations of cord blood T-Hg according to the current US-EPA reference dose (5.8{$\mu$}g/L for methylmercury). Mercury concentrations were related to maternal fish consumption, with large oily fish being the main contributor.},

Methods\textemdash We open with a discussion of children's vulnerability to neurotoxic substances, changes in the distribution of toxic exposures, and co-occurrence of social and physical exposures. We address trends in prevalence of mental health disorders, and approaches to the definition of disorders that are sensitive to the subtle effects of toxic exposures. We suggest broadening outcomes to include dimensional measures of autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and child learning capacity, as well as direct assessment of brain function. Findings\textemdash We consider the impact of two important exposures on children's mental health: lead and pesticides. We argue that longitudinal research designs may capture the cascading effects of exposures across biological systems and the full-range of neuropsychological endpoints. Neuroimaging is a valuable tool for observing brain maturation under varying environmental conditions. A dimensional approach to measurement may be sensitive to subtle sub-clinical toxic effects, permitting the development of exposure-related profiles and testing of complex functional relationships between brain and behavior. Questions about the neurotoxic effects of chemicals become more pressing when viewed through the lens of environmental justice. Conclusions\textemdash Reduction in the burden of child mental health disorders will require longitudinal study of neurotoxic exposures, incorporating dimensional approaches to outcome assessment and measures of brain function. Research that seeks to identify links between toxic exposures and mental health outcomes has enormous public health and societal value.},

Of the 156 pregnant women, chronic pain conditions were reported by 44 (28.2\%). The most common chronic pain complaints included neck and/or back pain (34.1\%) and headaches (31.8\%). Of subjects with chronic pain, 95.5\% were taking at least one prescription medication (mean\,=\,2.6\,{$\pm$}\,2.1, range of 0\textendash 10). Acetaminophen (43.2\%) and opioids (43.2\%) were the most common.

  abstract = {Objective We evaluated if acetaminophen, one of the most frequently used drugs among pregnant women is associated with an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities. Study Design We selected 88,142 pregnant women and their liveborn singletons from the Danish National Birth Cohort who had information on acetaminophen use during the first trimester of pregnancy. We used the National Hospital Registry to identify 3784 (4.3\%) children from the cohort diagnosed with 5847 congenital abnormalities. Results Children exposed to acetaminophen during the first trimester of pregnancy (n = 26,424) did not have an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities (hazard ratio = 1.01, 0.93-1.08) compared with nonexposed children (n = 61,718). No association was found between congenital abnormalities and duration of use during the first trimester. Increased prevalence was not observed for specific abnormalities, except for ``medial cysts, fistula, sinus'' (congenital abnormalities of the ear, face, and neck, ICD-10 code Q18.8, n = 43) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.15 (1.17-3.95). Conclusion Acetaminophen is not associated with an increased prevalence of congenital abnormalities overall or with any specific group of major abnormalities.},

  abstract = {Background Acetaminophen use during pregnancy has been associated with a reduced risk of stillbirth and preterm birth, but findings are based on few studies with small numbers of exposed women. Methods To examine whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort. We also examined the combined potential effects of acetaminophen, coffee and tobacco use on preeclampsia and preterm birth. The study population consisted of women who provided information on acetaminophen use during pregnancy and gave birth to singletons (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 98 140). The cohort was linked to the Danish National Hospital Registry and the Medical Birth Registry, which covers all Danish hospitals, miscarriages and births in Denmark. Results Women using acetaminophen during the third trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of preterm birth [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.14, 95\% CI: 1.03\textendash 1.26]. The risk of preterm birth was increased in mothers with pre-eclampsia (HR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.55, 95\% CI: 1.16\textendash 2.07) but not in women without pre-eclampsia (HR {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.08, 95\% CI: 0.97\textendash 1.20). Tobacco smoking and coffee consumption did not modify the effect of acetaminophen in any consistent pattern. No association was found between acetaminophen use and risk of preterm complications, miscarriages, stillbirths, low birth weight or small size for gestational age. Conclusion Findings do not provide strong support for a change in clinical practice regarding use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, but the increased risk of preterm birth among women with preeclampsia should be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is known that GDM is associated with an altered placental function and changes in placental gene regulation. More recent studies demonstrated an involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. So far, the focus regarding placental epigenetic changes in GDM was set on gene-specific DNA methylation analyses. Studies that robustly investigated placental global DNA methylation are lacking. However, several studies showed that tissue-specific alterations in global DNA methylation are independently associated with type 2 diabetes. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize global placental DNA methylation by robustly measuring placental DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) content and to examine whether differences in placental global DNA methylation are associated with GDM. Methods: Global DNA methylation was quantified by the current gold standard method, LC-MS/MS. In total, 1030 placental samples were analyzed in this single-center birth cohort study. Results: Mothers with GDM displayed a significantly increased global placental DNA methylation (3.22 {$\pm$} 0.63 vs. 3.00 {$\pm$} 0.46 \%; p = 0.013; {$\pm$}SD). Bivariate logistic regression showed a highly significant positive correlation between global placental DNA methylation and the presence of GDM (p = 0.0009). Quintile stratification according to placental DNA 5mC levels revealed that the frequency of GDM was evenly distributed in quintiles 1\textendash 4 (2.9\textendash 5.3 \%), whereas the frequency in the fifth quintile was significantly higher (10.7 \%; p = 0.003). Bivariate logistic models adjusted for maternal age, BMI, ethnicity, recurrent miscarriages, and familiar diabetes predisposition clearly demonstrated an independent association between global placental DNA hypermethylation and GDM. Furthermore, an ANCOVA model considering known predictors of DNA methylation substantiated an independent association between GDM and placental DNA methylation. Conclusions: This is the first study that employed a robust quantitative assessment of placental global DNA methylation in over a thousand placental samples. The study provides large scale evidence that placental global DNA hypermethylation is associated with GDM, independent of established risk factors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate if methylation status of CpG sites of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) promoter in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients is involved in pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of 50 SSc patients and 30 controls. After the extraction of total RNA and DNA contents from PBMCs, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized. Afterwards, quantitative analysis of IRF7 messenger RNA (mRNA) was conducted by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To evaluate the methylation status of the promoter region of IRF7 gene, PCR products of bisulfite-treated DNA from SSc patients and controls were sequenced. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of IRF7 in PBMCs from patients compared with controls was significantly upregulated. While limited cutaneous SSc patients expressed the mRNA of IRF7 higher than controls, the diffuse cutaneous SSc group did not demonstrate significantly increased expression in comparison to controls. Insignificant promoter hypomethylation of IRF7 was observed in SSc patients compared with the control group. However, CpG2 hypomethylation was significantly associated with increased SSc risk. Furthermore, overall promoter methylation and mRNA level of IRF7 were significantly correlated with each other. Nonetheless, none of them correlated with Rodnan score of SSc patients. There was significant difference in IRF7 mRNA expression between CpG8 methylated and unmethylated SSc patients. Moreover, the difference of methylation and expression was not significant between anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)-positive and ANA-negative SSc patients. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that hypomethylation of the IRF7 promoter might play a role in SSc pathogenesis, probably through promoting the IRF7 expression in PBMCs of patients with SSc.},

Two birth cohorts in Ribera d'Ebre and Menorca (Spain) were recruited between 1997 and 1999 (n = 475). Infants were assessed at age 4 years by using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Organochlorine compounds were measured in cord serum. Children's diet and parental sociodemographic information was obtained through questionnaire. Results showed that DDT cord serum concentration at birth was inversely associated with verbal, memory, quantitative, and perceptual-performance skills at age 4 years. Children whose DDT concentrations in cord serum were {$>$}0.20 ng/ml had mean decreases of 7.86 (standard error, 3.21) points in the verbal scale and 10.86 (standard error, 4.33) points in the memory scale when compared with children whose concentrations were {$<$}0.05 ng/ml. These associations were stronger among girls. Prenatal exposure to background, low-level concentrations of DDT was associated with a decrease in preschoolers' cognitive skills. These results should be considered when evaluating the risk and benefits of spraying DDT during antimalaria and other disease-vector campaigns.},

EDCs can interfere with/or mimic estrogenic hormones and, consequently, can simultaneously trigger diverse signaling pathways which result in diverse and divergent biological responses. Additionally, EDCs can also bioaccumulate in lipid compartments of the organism forming a mixed ``body burden'' of contaminants. Although the independent action of chemicals has been considered the main principle in EDCs mixture toxicity, recent studies have demonstrated that numerous effects cannot be predicted when analyzing single compounds independently. Co-exposure to these agents, particularly in critical windows of exposure, may induce hazardous health effects potentially associated with a complex ``body burden'' of different origins. Here, we performed an exhaustive review of the available literature regarding EDCs mixtures exposure, toxicity mechanisms and effects, particularly at the most vulnerable human life stages. Although the assessment of potential risks to human health due to exposure to EDCs mixtures is a major topic for consumer safety, information regarding effective mixtures effects is still scarce.},

Recent studies have suggested that mutations on the paternal, but not the maternal, GNAS allele could be associated with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and thus small size for gestational age. Objectives: The aim of the study was to confirm and expand these findings in a large number of patients presenting with either PHP-Ia or PPHP/POH. Patients and Methods: We collected birth parameters (ie, gestational age, weight, length, and head circumference) of patients with either PHP-Ia (n = 29) or PPHP/POH (n = 26) with verified GNAS mutations. The parental allele carrying the mutation was assessed by investigating the parents or, when a de novo mutation was identified, through informative intragenic polymorphisms. Results: Heterozygous GNAS mutations on either parental allele were associated with IUGR. However, when these mutations are located on the paternal GNAS allele, IUGR was considerably more pronounced than with mutations on the maternal allele. Moreover, birth weights were lower with paternal GNAS mutations affecting exons 2\textendash 13 than with exon 1/intron 1 mutations. Conclusions: These data indicate that a paternally derived GNAS transcript, possibly XL{$\alpha$}s, is required for normal fetal growth and development and that this transcript affects placental functions. Thus, similar to other imprinted genes, GNAS controls growth and/or fetal development.},

OBJECTIVES: Examine associations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen use during pregnancy and infancy with executive function and behaviour problems in children. METHODS: We included 1225 mother-child pairs from Project Viva, a pre-birth cohort study. We assessed prenatal acetaminophen and ibuprofen use in early and mid-pregnancy and infant use in the first year of life using questionnaires. Parents and classroom teachers assessed child behaviours in mid-childhood (median 8~years), using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), with higher scores indicating worse functioning for both. We examined associations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen use during pregnancy and infancy with mid-childhood neurobehavioural outcomes using linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: During pregnancy, 46.1\% of mothers used acetaminophen {$\geq$}10 times and 18.4\% used any ibuprofen. In the first year, 65.3\% and 39.6\% of infants received acetaminophen and ibuprofen {$\geq$}6 times, respectively. Higher ({$\geq$}10 vs {$<$}10 times) prenatal acetaminophen ({$\beta$} 1.64 points; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.59, 2.68) and any ibuprofen ({$\beta$} 1.56, 95\% CI 0.19, 2.92) were associated with higher parent-rated BRIEF global scores. Patterns of association were linear across categories and were similar for other parent- and teacher-rated outcomes. Infancy exposure ({$\geq$}6 vs {$<$}6 times) to acetaminophen ({$\beta$} 1.69, 95\% CI 0.51, 2.87) and ibuprofen ({$\beta$} 1.40, 95\% CI 0.25, 2.55) were associated with higher parent-rated BRIEF GEC scores but associations with teacher-rated scores were weaker. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal and early-life exposure to acetaminophen and ibuprofen were associated with poorer executive function and behaviour in childhood. These findings highlight the need for further research on the mechanisms through which analgesics may act on fetal and child brain development.},

In animals and humans, this exposure during critical developmental windows has been associated with various developmental abnormalities, including the emergence of psychiatric disorders. We aimed to review the association between perinatal endocrine disruptor exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders in humans, focusing on cognitive and psychiatric disorders. Methods: We performed a systematic review with key words referring to the fields of neurodevelopment and endocrine disruptors. We reviewed 896 titles, choosing studies on the basis of titles and abstracts. We searched through the methodology sections to find perinatal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, following the categories indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition). References in some studies brought us to a total of 47 studies included here. Results: Convergent studies report an association between exposure to endocrine disruptors and autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, communication disorders and unspecified neurodevelopmental disorders. Conclusion: Sufficient data exist to report that exposure to some endocrine disruptors is a risk factor for the emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Studying endocrine disruptor exposure in humans is still associated with some limits that are difficult to overcome.},

Estimates on 81 environmental exposures of current health concern were obtained for 728 women enrolled in The INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente) birth cohort, in Sabadell, Spain, using biomonitoring, geospatial modeling, remote sensors, and questionnaires. Pair-wise Pearson's and polychoric correlations were calculated and principal components were derived. The median absolute correlation across all exposures was 0.06 (5th-95th centiles, 0.01-0.54). There were strong levels of correlation within families of exposure (median = 0.45, 5th-95th centiles, 0.07-0.85). Nine exposures (11\%) had a correlation higher than 0.5 with at least one exposure outside their exposure family. Effectively all the variance in the data set (99.5\%) was explained by 40 principal components. Future exposome studies should interpret exposure effects in light of their correlations to other exposures. The weak to moderate correlation observed between exposure families will permit adjustment for confounding in future exposome studies.},

  abstract = {The exposome concept takes a holistic approach facilitated by new and emerging technologies to describe `the totality of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) exposures from conception onwards, complementing the genome'. It provides a framework to advance the environmental epidemiology field that has until now focused almost exclusively on single-exposure health effects. The exposome includes an external domain, measured by methods including geo-spatial modelling, questionnaire and biomonitoring of external exposures while the internal domain is commonly assessed through molecular omics platforms. The internal domain, in part, reflects the biological response to the external domain. New statistical frameworks are required to integrate and assess exposome-health effects. The pregnancy period is a key starting point to describe the dynamic exposome, due to its heightened sensitivity and potential lifetime impact. A handful of studies have started to move towards an exposome approach in assessing the effects of the multiple exposures during pregnancy on child development. New research projects are underway to test the exposome approach on a large scale.},

  abstract = {Background Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased in prevalence in the past decade. Studies attempting to identify a specific genetic component have not been able to account for much of the heritability of ADHD, indicating there may be gene-environment interactions underlying the disorder, including early exposure to environmental chemicals. Based on several relevant studies, we chose to examine bisphenol A (BPA) as a possible contributor to ADHD in humans. BPA is a widespread environmental chemical that has been shown to disrupt neurodevelopment in rodents and humans. Objectives Using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework, a systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to determine the relationship between early life exposure to BPA and hyperactivity, a key diagnostic criterion of ADHD. Data sources Searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Toxline were completed for all literature to January 1, 2017. Study eligibility criteria For inclusion, the studies had to publish original data, be in the English language, include a measure of BPA exposure, and assess if BPA exposure affected hyperactive behaviors in mice, rats or humans. Exposure to BPA had to occur at {$<$}3 months of age for humans, up to postnatal day 35 for rats and up to postnatal day 40 for mice. Exposure could occur either gestationally (via maternal exposure) or directly to the offspring. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Studies were evaluated using the OHAT risk of bias tool. The effects in humans were assessed qualitatively. For rodents exposed to 20 {$\mu$}g/kg/day BPA, we evaluated the study findings in a random effects meta-analytical model. Results A review of the literature identified 29 rodent and 3 human studies. A random effects meta-analysis showed significantly increased hyperactivity in male rodents. In humans, early BPA exposure was associated with hyperactivity in boys and girls. Limitations, conclusions, and implications of key findings We concluded that early life BPA exposure is a presumed human hazard for the development of hyperactivity. Possible limitations of this systematic review include deficiencies in author reporting, exclusion of some literature based on language, and insufficient similarity between human studies. SRs that result in hazard-based conclusions are the first step in assessing and mitigating risks. Given the widespread exposure of BPA and increasing diagnoses of ADHD, we recommend immediate actions to complete such risk analyses and take next steps for the protection of human health. In the meantime, precautionary measures should be taken to reduce exposure in pregnant women, infants and children. The present analysis also discusses potential mechanisms by which BPA affects hyperactivity, and the most effective avenues for future research. Systematic review registration number Not available.},

  abstract = {Background Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is caused by (epi)genetic defects in the imprinted GNAS cluster. Current classification of PHP patients is hampered by clinical and molecular diagnostic overlaps. The European Consortium for the study of PHP designed a genome-wide methylation study to improve molecular diagnosis. Methods The HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip was used to analyze genome-wide methylation in 24 PHP patients with parathyroid hormone resistance and 20 age- and gender-matched controls. Patients were previously diagnosed with GNAS-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and include 6 patients with known STX16 deletion (PHP{$\Delta$}stx16) and 18 without deletion (PHPneg). Results The array demonstrated that PHP patients do not show DNA methylation differences at the whole-genome level. Unsupervised clustering of GNAS-specific DMRs divides PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 versus PHPneg patients. Interestingly, in contrast to the notion that all PHP patients share methylation defects in the A/B DMR while only PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 patients have normal NESP, GNAS-AS1 and XL methylation, we found a novel DMR (named GNAS-AS2) in the GNAS-AS1 region that is significantly different in both PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 and PHPneg, as validated by Sequenom EpiTYPER in a larger PHP cohort. The analysis of 58 DMRs revealed that 8/18 PHPneg and 1/6 PHP{$\Delta$}stx16 patients have multi-locus methylation defects. Validation was performed for FANCC and SVOPL DMRs. Conclusions This is the first genome-wide methylation study for PHP patients that confirmed that GNAS is the most significant DMR, and the presence of STX16 deletion divides PHP patients in two groups. Moreover, a novel GNAS-AS2 DMR affects all PHP patients, and PHP patients seem sensitive to multi-locus methylation defects.

There is epidemiological evidence for an association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and decreased anogenital distance, as well as an association between an exposure to EDCs in adulthood and semen quality. However, some of these findings are inconsistent across studies. There is less evidence about the role of prenatal exposure to EDCs for semen quality, and only few studies have investigated the role of prenatal EDC exposure in testicular cancer occurrence. This is due to a lack of long-term follow-up studies linking prenatal exposures with male reproductive disorders in adulthood. More research is needed investigating the role of EDC exposure for male reproductive health, particularly long-term follow-up studies to assess the outcomes in adulthood.},

  abstract = {Background: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which refers to reduced fetal growth in the context of placental insufficiency, is etiologically heterogeneous. IUGR is associated not only with perinatal morbidity and mortality but also with adult-onset disorders, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, posing a major health burden. Placental epigenetic dysregulation has been proposed as one mechanism that causes IUGR; however, the spectrum of epigenetic pathophysiological mechanisms leading to IUGR remains to be elucidated. Monozygotic monochorionic twins are particularly affected by IUGR, in the setting of severe discordant growth. Because monozygotic twins have the same genotype at conception and a shared maternal environment, they provide an ideal model system for studying epigenetic dysregulation of the placenta. Results: We compared genome-wide placental DNA methylation patterns of severely growth-discordant twins to identify novel candidate genes for IUGR. Snap-frozen placental samples for eight severely growth-discordant monozygotic monochorionic twin pairs were obtained at delivery from each twin. A high-resolution DNA methylation array platform was used to identify methylation differences between IUGR and normal twins. Our analysis revealed differentially methylated regions in the promoters of eight genes: DECR1, ZNF300, DNAJA4, CCL28, LEPR, HSPA1A/L, GSTO1, and GNE. The largest methylation differences between the two groups were in the promoters of DECR1 and ZNF300. The significance of these group differences was independently validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing, implicating aberrations in fatty acid beta oxidation and transcriptional regulation, respectively. Further analysis of the array data identified methylation changes most prominently affecting the Wnt and cadherin pathways in the IUGR cohort. Conclusions: Our results suggest that IUGR in monozygotic twins is associated with impairments in lipid metabolism and transcriptional regulation as well as cadherin and Wnt signaling. We show that monozygotic monochorionic twins discordant for growth provide a useful model to study one type of the epigenetic placental dysregulation that drives IUGR.},

Herein, we focus on two well-defined extrinsic environmental factors that lead to sexually dimorphic behavioral differences in animal models and linkage in human epidemiological studies. These include maternal or psychosocial stress (such as social stress) and exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds (such as one of the most prevalent, bisphenol A [BPA]). In general, the evidence suggests that early environmental exposures, such as BPA and stress, lead to more pronounced behavioral deficits in males than in females, whereas female neurobehavioral patterns are more vulnerable to later in life stress. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences and developmental timing when examining the effects of environmental factors on later neurobehavioral outcomes.},

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between prenatal and early-life exposures to 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-ethylene (p,p'-DDE) and behaviors in children between 5 and 9 y of age. METHODS: In the Biopersistent organochlorines in diet and human fertility: Epidemiologic studies of time to pregnancy and semen quality in Inuit and European populations (INUENDO) cohort, consisting of mother-child pairs from Greenland and Ukraine (n=1,018), maternal serum PCB-153 and p,p'-DDE concentrations were measured during pregnancy, and cumulative postnatal exposures during the first 12 months after delivery were estimated using a pharmacokinetic model. Parents completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and children's behaviors were dichotomized as abnormal (high) versus normal/borderline for five SDQ subscales and the total difficulties score. RESULTS: The total difficulties score, an overall measure of abnormal behavior, was not clearly associated with pre- or postnatal exposures to PCB-153 or to p,p'-DDE. However, pooled adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for high conduct problem scores with a doubling of exposure were 1.19 (95\% CI: 0.99, 1.42) and 1.16 (95\% CI: 0.96, 1.41) for pre- and postnatal PCB-153, respectively, and 1.25 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.51) and 1.24 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.51) for pre- and postnatal p,p'-DDE, respectively. Corresponding ORs for high hyperactivity scores were 1.24 (95\% CI: 0.94, 1.62) and 1.08 (95\% CI: 0.81, 1.45) for pre- and postnatal PCB-153, respectively, and 1.43 (95\% CI: 1.06, 1.92) and 1.27 (95\% CI: 0.93, 1.73) for pre- and postnatal p,p'-DDE, respectively. CONCLUSION: Prenatal and early postnatal exposures to p,p'-DDE and PCB-153 were associated with a higher prevalence of abnormal scores for conduct and hyperactivity at 5\textendash 9 y of age in our study population. These findings provide further support for the importance of minimizing organochlorine exposures to young children and to women of childbearing age. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP553.},

Unfortunately, reducing the type I error for null associations increases the type II error for those associations that are not null. The theoretical basis for advocating a routine adjustment for multiple comparisons is the "universal null hypothesis" that "chance" serves as the first-order explanation for observed phenomena. This hypothesis undermines the basic premises of empirical research, which holds that nature follows regular laws that may be studied through observations. A policy of not making adjustments for multiple comparisons is preferable because it will lead to fewer errors of interpretation when the data under evaluation are not random numbers but actual observations on nature. Furthermore, scientists should not be so reluctant to explore leads that may turn out to be wrong that they penalize themselves by missing possibly important findings.},

Here I demonstrate how analysis of genomic information can provide new insights into endocrine systems, using the human growth hormone (GH) signaling pathway as an illustrative example. GH is essential for normal postnatal growth in children, and plays important roles in other biological processes throughout life. GH actions are mediated by the GH receptor, primarily via the JAK2 protein tyrosine kinase and the STAT5B transcription factor, and inactivating mutations in this pathway all lead to impaired somatic growth. Variation in GH signaling genes has been evaluated using DNA sequence data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium, a compendium of information from {$>$}60,000 individuals. Results reveal many potential missense and other alterations in the coding regions ofGH1,GHR,JAK2, andSTAT5B, with most changes being uncommon. The total number of different alleles per gene varied by \textasciitilde threefold, from 101 forGH1 to 338 forJAK2. Several known disease-linked mutations inGH1,GHR, andJAK2 were present but infrequent in the population; however, three amino acid changes inGHR were sufficiently prevalent (\textasciitilde 4\% to 44\% of chromosomes) to suggest that they are not disease causing. Collectively, these data provide new opportunities to understand how genetically driven variability in GH signaling and action may modify human physiology and disease., Extensive population variation in GH signaling proteins predicted in a human genome database provides new opportunities to understand the range of normal GH physiology and pathophysiology.},

We designed a strategy for investigating this reprogramming, which consisted of identifying a large number of tissue-restricted genes that are epigenetically silenced in normal somatic cells and then detecting their expression in cancer. This approach led to the demonstration that large-scale ``off-context'' gene activations systematically occur in a variety of cancer types. In our series of 293 lung tumors, we identified an ectopic gene expression signature associated with a subset of highly aggressive tumors, which predicted poor prognosis independently of the TNM (tumor size, node positivity, and metastasis) stage or histological subtype. The ability to isolate these tumors allowed us to reveal their common molecular features characterized by the acquisition of embryonic stem cell/germ cell gene expression profiles and the down-regulation of immune response genes. The methodical recognition of ectopic gene activations in cancer cells could serve as a basis for gene signature\textendash guided tumor stratification, as well as for the discovery of oncogenic mechanisms, and expand the understanding of the biology of very aggressive tumors. Large-scale detection of ectopic gene activations reveals a source of potential cancer biomarkers and correlates with aggressive metastasis-prone lung tumors.

  abstract = {Phthalates (dialkyl or alkyl phenyl esters of phthalic acid, benzene-1.2-dicarboxylic acid) are a group of industrial chemicals that have been used for more than 50 years. Phthalates are ubiquitous and can potentially have adverse effects on humans. The present study presents an accurate, sensitive and automated analytical method for measuring 12 phthalate metabolites (free and conjugated) in human urine using on-line solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - tandem mass spectrometry. A small volume of urine sample (300{$\mu$}L) is required. Glucoronidated phthalate metabolites are deconjugated by incubation with glucoronidase enzyme (Escherihia coli-K 12) and the reaction is stopped by adding formic acid. This is the only sample preparation needed prior to injection into the column switching system. Thus, the method involves minimal sample handling and minimizes possible contaminations from the surroundings. The method was validated by spiking synthetic urine at 5-8 levels in the range of 0.1-500ng phthalate metabolites/mL synthetic urine. The method is sensitive with limits of detection in the low nanogram range, and rapid with a total run time about 25min. The accuracy was between 90 and 120 \% and the intermediate precision was given as relative standard deviation was below 20\% for most of the compounds. The high sensitivity, high throughput and minimal manual handling make the method suitable for large-scale biomonitoring studies. The present method was applied for the determination of phthalate metabolites in urine samples from 116 pregnant women, a subproject within the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Concentrations of all the twelve phthalate metabolites was {$>$}LOQ in 100\% of the samples analysed. Mean urinary concentrations for different phthalate metabolites ranged from 1 to 100ng/mL, the highest concentrations were observed for di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites and lowest for di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites. The urinary concentrations for most of the phthalate metabolites in the present study were found to be in the same range as found in other studies of pregnant women.},

  abstract = {According to the ``Developmental Origins of Health and Disease'' (DOHaD) concept, the early-life environment is a critical period for fetal programming. Given the epidemiological evidence that air pollution exposure during pregnancy adversely affects newborn outcomes such as birth weight and preterm birth, there is a need to pay attention to underlying modes of action to better understand not only these air pollution-induced early health effects but also its later-life consequences. In this review, we give an overview of air pollution-induced placental molecular alterations observed in the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort and evaluate the existing evidence. In general, we showed that prenatal exposure to air pollution is associated with nitrosative stress and epigenetic alterations in the placenta. Adversely affected CpG targets were involved in cellular processes including DNA repair, circadian rhythm, and energy metabolism. For miRNA expression, specific air pollution exposure windows were associated with altered miR-20a, miR-21, miR-146a, and miR-222 expression. Early-life aging markers including telomere length and mitochondrial DNA content are associated with air pollution exposure during pregnancy. Previously, we proposed the air pollution-induced telomere-mitochondrial aging hypothesis with a direct link between telomeres and mitochondria. Here, we extend this view with a potential co-interaction of different biological mechanisms on the level of placental oxidative stress, epigenetics, aging, and energy metabolism. Investigating the placenta is an opportunity for future research as it may help to understand the fundamental biology underpinning the DOHaD concept through the interactions between the underlying modes of action, prenatal environment, and disease risk in later life. To prevent lasting consequences from early-life exposures of air pollution, policy makers should get a basic understanding of biomolecular consequences and transgenerational risks.},

Most commonly, they assess DNA-methylation status at cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, using platforms such as the Illumina 450k array that profile a subset of CpGs genome wide. An important challenge in the context of EWAS is determining a significance threshold for declaring a CpG site as differentially methylated, taking multiple testing into account. We used a permutation method to estimate a significance threshold specifically for the 450k array and a simulation extrapolation approach to estimate a genome-wide threshold. These methods were applied to five different EWAS datasets derived from a variety of populations and tissue types. We obtained an estimate of for the 450k array, and a genome-wide estimate of . We further demonstrate the importance of these results by showing that previously recommended sample sizes for EWAS should be adjusted upwards, requiring samples between {$\sim$}10\% and {$\sim$}20\% larger in order to maintain type-1 errors at the desired level.},

Due to evidence of their estrogenic activity, they have been considered as chemicals of concern. The exposure of the Norwegian population to these compounds is presently unknown. AIMS: To measure urinary levels of twelve different environmental phenols including four emerging bisphenols: S, F, B and AF (abbreviated as BPS, BPF, BPB and BPAF, respectively) in a healthy Norwegian population. We have calculated short-term variability, estimated daily intakes and investigated important determinants of exposure. METHODS: Urine samples were collected from mothers (n = 48) and their children (n = 56) during spring/summer 2012 in two counties in Norway. RESULTS: Six environmental phenols namely methyl, ethyl and propyl paraben, BPA, BP-3 and TCS were detected in almost 100\% of the urine samples. Among the emerging bisphenols, BPS was detected most frequently in the urine samples (42-48\%) followed by BPF (4-15\%). Parabens were positively and significantly correlated to each other in both mothers and children. Levels of parabens and BP-3 were higher in mothers compared to children. All mothers and children had lower estimated daily intakes (back calculated from the urinary concentrations) of parabens and BPA than the respective acceptable and tolerable daily intakes (ADIs and TDIs) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Observed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated moderate to high reliability of spot urine measurements for all the environmental phenols (ICCs: 0.70-0.97). Use of hair products, deodorants, face and hand creams were significantly associated with higher urinary levels of parabens. CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of environmental phenols in healthy Norwegian women and children is abundant. Among emerging bisphenols, there is widespread exposure to BPS. A single spot urine sample can be used for estimating short-term exposures of environmental phenols. Urinary levels of parabens were associated with use of PCPs.},

  abstract = {Lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) neurotoxicity is well established. In recent years, a growing body of evidence suggests that environmental exposure to other metals including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), and their mixtures also pose public health threats. In this paper we summarize the recent literature examining the relationship of prenatal and childhood environmental metal exposures with cognitive and behavioral outcomes in children. We conducted a literature search to identify epidemiologic studies that examined the relationship of Cd, Mn, and metal mixtures with children's neurodevelopmental/cognitive and behavioral outcomes. We restricted the search to peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 2009 and March 2015. We identified a total of 31 articles of which 16, 17, and 16 studies examined the effects of Cd, Mn, or metal mixtures, respectively. Based on our review, there is suggestive evidence that prenatal/childhood Cd exposure may be associated with poorer cognition, but additional research is clearly needed. We found little evidence of behavioral effects of early life Cd exposure, and no studies found a significant relationship with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Studies of early life Mn exposure consistently reported negative impacts on both cognition and behavior. There is also growing evidence that co-exposure to multiple metals can result in increased neurotoxicity compared to single metal exposures, in particular during early life. Few studies have evaluated behavioral effects related to metal co-exposures.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic mark and CpG methylation is central to many biological processes and human diseases. Since cancer has highlighted the contribution to disease of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as the presence of promoter CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of tumor suppressor genes and global DNA hypomethylation defects, their importance will surely become apparent in other pathologies. However, advances in obtaining comprehensive DNA methylomes are hampered by the high cost and time-consuming aspects of the single nucleotide methods currently available for whole genome DNA methylation analyses. Following the success of the standard CpG methylation microarrays for 1,505 CpG sites and 27,000 CpG sites, we have validated in vivo the newly developed 450,000 (450K) cytosine microarray (Illumina). The 450K microarray includes CpG and CNG sites, CpG islands/shores/shelves/open sea, non-coding RNA (microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) and sites surrounding the transcription start sites (-200 bp to -1,500 bp, 5'-UTRs and exons 1) for coding genes, but also for the corresponding gene bodies and 3'-UTRs, in addition to intergenic regions derived from GWAS studies. Herein, we demonstrate that the 450K DNA methylation array can consistently and significantly detect CpG methylation changes in the HCT-116 colorectal cancer cell line in comparison with normal colon mucosa or HCT-116 cells with defective DNA methyltransferases (DKO). The provided validation highlights the potential use of the 450K DNA methylation microarray as a useful tool for ongoing and newly designed epigenome projects.},

Pregnant mice were exposed to 50-mg BP-3/kg body weight/day or olive oil (vehicle) from gestation day (gd) 0 to gd6 by dermal exposure. High-frequency ultrasound imaging was used to follow up fetal and placental growth in vivo. Blood flow parameters in uterine and umbilical arteries were analyzed by Doppler measurements. Mice were killed at gd5, gd10, and gd14 on the first pregnancy, and at gd10 and 14 on the second pregnancy. The weight of the first and second progenies was recorded, and sex ratio was analyzed. BP-3 levels were analyzed in serum and amniotic fluid. BP-3 reduced the fetal weight at gd14 and feto-placenta index of first pregnancy, with 16.13\% of fetuses under the 5th percentile; arteria uterina parameters showed altered pattern at gd10. BP-3 was detected in serum 4~h after the exposure at gd6, and in amniotic fluid at gd14. Offspring weight of first progeny was lower in BP-3 group. Placenta weights of BP-3 group were decreased in second pregnancy. First and second progenies of mothers exposed to BP-3 showed a higher percentage of females (female sex ratio). Dermal exposure to low dose of BP-3 during early pregnancy resulted in an intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) phenotype, disturbed sex ratio and alterations in the growth curve of the offspring in mouse model.},

Of these women, 9065 (4.2\%), 148,697 (68.1\%), 42,678 (19.6\%), 13,084 (6.0\%), 3597 (1.6\%), and 1095 (0.5\%) were underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grades 1, 2, and 3 obese women, respectively. A total of 138, 517 women from 26 cohorts had pregnancies with no hypertensive or diabetic disorders and with term deliveries of appropriate for gestational age at birth infants. Gestational weight gain charts for underweight, normal weight, overweight, and grade 1, 2, and 3 obese women were derived by the Box-Cox t method using the generalized additive model for location, scale, and shape. Results: We observed that gestational weight gain strongly differed per maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index group. The median (interquartile range) gestational weight gain at 40 weeks was 14.2 kg (11.4\textendash 17.4) for underweight women, 14.5 kg (11.5\textendash 17.7) for normal weight women, 13.9 kg (10.1\textendash 17.9) for overweight women, and 11.2 kg (7.0\textendash 15.7), 8.7 kg (4.3\textendash 13.4) and 6.3 kg (1.9\textendash 11.1) for grades 1, 2, and 3 obese women, respectively. The rate of weight gain was lower in the first half than in the second half of pregnancy. No differences in the patterns of weight gain were observed between cohorts or countries. Similar weight gain patterns were observed in mothers without pregnancy complications. Conclusions: Gestational weight gain patterns are strongly related to pre-pregnancy body mass index. The derived charts can be used to assess gestational weight gain in etiological research and as a monitoring tool for weight gain during pregnancy in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Exposure to pesticides is a major factor in the cause of dysfunction in the nervous system and neurodevelopment disorders in children at critical periods of great vulnerability. The aim of this study was to review scientific evidence published on neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal and postnatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (OPs) in different stages, including neonates, infants, toddlers, preschool children, and school-age children. Full-text articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and ISI databases between 1973 and 2019 were reviewed and the scientific evidence was evaluated. Results: Fifty studies were eligible for inclusion in this quantitative synthesis. Fifteen of these papers evaluated the effects on neonates and infants, 18 on the effects on toddlers and preschool children, and 24 the effects on school-age children. Considerable evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to OPs contributes to child neurodevelopment disorders in all stages, whereas data about the effects of postnatal exposure are limited. Therefore, the available evidence supports the theory that sensitive time-windows occur prenatally rather than postnatally. Although 45 out of the total 50 selected articles found an association between OP exposure and child neurodevelopment, some of the evidence is controversial. A standardized methodology is needed to enable the comparison of the results in several studies, and further research studies are needed to warrant firmer conclusions. A systematic review of this evidence should be performed continuously to update the state of knowledge regarding neurodevelopmental effects associated with OP exposure.},

  abstract = {Lipid traits (total, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides) are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. DNA methylation is not only an inherited but also modifiable epigenetic mark that has been related to cardiovascular risk factors. Our aim was to identify loci showing differential DNA methylation related to serum lipid levels. Blood DNA methylation was assessed using the Illumina Human Methylation 450 BeadChip. A two-stage epigenome-wide association study was performed, with a discovery sample in the REGICOR study (n\,=\,645) and validation in the Framingham Offspring Study (n\,=\,2,542). Fourteen CpG sites located in nine genes (SREBF1, SREBF2, PHOSPHO1, SYNGAP1, ABCG1, CPT1A, MYLIP, TXNIP and SLC7A11) and 2 intergenic regions showed differential methylation in association with lipid traits. Six of these genes and 1 intergenic region were new discoveries showing differential methylation related to total cholesterol (SREBF2), HDL-cholesterol (PHOSPHO1, SYNGAP1 and an intergenic region in chromosome 2) and triglycerides (MYLIP, TXNIP and SLC7A11). These CpGs explained 0.7\%, 9.5\% and 18.9\% of the variability of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the Framingham Offspring Study, respectively. The expression of the genes SREBF2 and SREBF1 was inversely associated with methylation of their corresponding CpGs (P-value\,=\,0.0042 and 0.0045, respectively) in participants of the GOLDN study (n\,=\,98). In turn, SREBF1 expression was directly associated with HDL cholesterol (P-value\,=\,0.0429). Genetic variants in SREBF1, PHOSPHO1, ABCG1 and CPT1A were also associated with lipid profile. Further research is warranted to functionally validate these new loci and assess the causality of new and established associations between these differentially methylated loci and lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {Copper is an important trace element that is required for essential enzymes. However, due to its redox activity, copper can also lead to the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species. Therefore, cellular uptake, storage as well as export of copper have to be tightly regulated in order to guarantee sufficient copper supply for the synthesis of copper-containing enzymes but also to prevent copper-induced oxidative stress. In brain, copper is of importance for normal development. In addition, both copper deficiency as well as excess of copper can seriously affect brain functions. Therefore, this organ possesses ample mechanisms to regulate its copper metabolism. In brain, astrocytes are considered as important regulators of copper homeostasis. Impairments of homeostatic mechanisms in brain copper metabolism have been associated with neurodegeneration in human disorders such as Menkes disease, Wilson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. This review article will summarize the biological functions of copper in the brain and will describe the current knowledge on the mechanisms involved in copper transport, storage and export of brain cells. The role of copper in diseases that have been connected with disturbances in brain copper homeostasis will also be discussed.},

Since DNA methylomes are highly cell type specific, deconvolution methods can be used to recover cell type\textendash specific information in the form of latent methylation components (LMCs) from such `bulk' samples. Reference-free deconvolution methods retrieve these components without the need for DNA methylation profiles of purified cell types. Currently no integrated and guided procedure is available for data preparation and subsequent interpretation of deconvolution results.

Our protocol simplifies the analysis and guides the initial interpretation of DNA methylation data derived from complex samples. The harmonized approach is particularly useful to dissect and evaluate cell heterogeneity in complex systems such as tumors.

A notable feature of boosting is that the technique has a built-in mechanism for shrinking coefficient estimates and variable selection. This regularization mechanism makes boosting a suitable method for analyzing data characterized by small sample sizes and large numbers of predictors. We extend the existing methodology by developing a boosting method for prediction functions with multiple components. Such multidimensional functions occur in many types of statistical models, for example in count data models and in models involving outcome variables with a mixture distribution. As will be demonstrated, the new algorithm is suitable for both the estimation of the prediction function and regularization of the estimates. In addition, nuisance parameters can be estimated simultaneously with the prediction function.},

We hypothesized that the glucocorticoid receptor (Gr, Nr3c1) fashions the DNA methylation profile of offspring. Consistent with this hypothesis, fetal Nr3c1 heterozygosity leads to altered DNA methylation landscape in fetal placenta in a sex-specific manner. There was a significant overlap of differentially methylated genes in fetal placenta and adult frontal cortex in Nr3c1 heterozygotes. Phenotypically, Nr3c1 heterozygotes show significantly more anxiety-like behavior than wildtype. DNA methylation status of fetal placental tissue is significantly correlated with anxiety-like behavior of the same animals in adulthood. Thus, placental DNA methylation might predict behavioral phenotypes in adulthood. Our data supports the hypothesis that Nr3c1 influences DNA methylation at birth and that DNA methylation in placenta correlates with adult frontal cortex DNA methylation and anxiety-like phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Human placenta is a fetal-derived tissue that offers a unique sample of epigenetic and environmental exposures present in utero. In the MARBLES prospective pregnancy study of high-risk younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), pregnancy and environmental factors collected by maternal interviews were examined as predictors of placental DNA methylation, including partially methylated domains (PMDs), an embryonic feature of the placental methylome. DNA methylation data from MethylC-seq analysis of 47 placentas of children clinically diagnosed at 3 years with ASD or typical development using standardized assessments were examined in relation to: child's gestational age, birthweight, and diagnosis; maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, education, parity, height, prenatal vitamin and folate intake; home ownership; pesticides professionally applied to lawns or gardens or inside homes, pet flea/tick pouches, collars, or soaps/shampoos used in the 3 months prior to or during pregnancy. Sequencing run, order, and coverage, and child race and sex were considered as potential confounders. Akaike information criterion was used to select the most parsimonious among candidate models. Final prediction models used sandwich estimators to produce homoscadisticity-robust estimates of the 95\% confidence interval (CI) and P-values controlled the false discovery rate at 5\%. The strongest, most robust associations were between pesticides professionally applied outside the home and higher average methylation over PMDs [0.45 (95\% CI 0.17, 0.72), P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03] and a reduced proportion of the genome in PMDs [\`A0.42 (95\% CI \`A 0.67 to \`A 0.17), P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.03]. Pesticide exposures could alter placental DNA methylation more than other factors.},

  abstract = {Background: Regression analysis is an important statistical method for the analysis of medical data. It enables the identification and characterization of relationships among multiple factors. It also enables the identification of prognostically relevant risk factors and the calculation of risk scores for individual prognostication. Methods: This article is based on selected textbooks of statistics, a selective review of the literature, and our own experience. Results: After a brief introduction of the uni- and multivariable regression models, illustrative examples are given to explain what the important considerations are before a regression analysis is performed, and how the results should be interpreted. The reader should then be able to judge whether the method has been used correctly and interpret the results appropriately. Conclusion: The performance and interpretation of linear regression analysis are subject to a variety of pitfalls, which are discussed here in detail. The reader is made aware of common errors of interpretation through practical examples. Both the opportunities for applying linear regression analysis and its limitations are presented. {$\blackpointerright$}Cite this as: Schneider A, Hommel G, Blettner M: Linear regression analysis\textemdash part 14 of a series on evaluation of scientific publications.

The ``fetal origins'' hypothesis postulates that adverse intrauterine exposures are associated with later disease susceptibility. Our recent studies have focused on the placental epigenome at term. We extended these studies to genome-wide placental DNA methylation across a wide range of gestational ages. We applied methylation dependent immunoprecipitation/DNA sequencing (MeDIP-seq) to 9 placentas with gestational age from 25\,weeks to term to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs).},

  abstract = {While it is well accepted that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable disorder, not all of the risk is genetic. It is estimated that between 10 and 40\% of the variance associated with ADHD is likely to be accounted for by environmental factors. There is considerable interest in the role that the prenatal environment might play in the development of ADHD with previous reviews concluding that despite demonstration of associations between prenatal risk factors (e.g. prematurity, maternal smoking during pregnancy) and ADHD, there remains insufficient evidence to support a definite causal relationship. This article provides an update of research investigating the relationship between prenatal risk factors and ADHD published over the past 3~years. Recently, several epidemiological and data linkage studies have made substantial contributions to our understanding of this relationship. In particular, these studies have started to account for some of the genetic and familial confounds that, when taken into account, throw several established findings into doubt. None of the proposed prenatal risk factors can be confirmed as causal for ADHD, and the stronger the study design, the less likely it is to support an association. We need a new benchmark for studies investigating the etiology of ADHD whereby there is an expectation not only that data will be collected prospectively but also that the design allows the broad range of genetic and familial factors to be accounted for.},

  abstract = {Ototoxicity is known to cause permanent loss of vestibule function through degeneration of sensory hair cells (HCs). However, functional recovery has been reported during washout after chronic ototoxicity, although the mechanisms underlying this reversible dysfunction are unknown. Here, we study this question in rats chronically exposed to the ototoxic compound 3,3{${'}$}-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN). Pronounced alterations in vestibular function appeared before significant loss of HCs or stereociliary coalescence became evident by ultrastructural analyses. This early dysfunction was fully reversible if the exposure was terminated promptly. In cristae and utricles, the distinct junctions formed between type I HCs (HCI) and calyx endings were completely dismantled at these early stages of reversible dysfunction, and completely rebuilt during washout. Immunohistochemical observations revealed loss and recovery of the junction proteins CASPR1 and tenascin-C and RT-PCR indicated that their loss was not due to decreased gene expression. KCNQ4 was mislocalized during intoxication and recovered control-like localization after washout. At early stages of the intoxication, the calyces could be classified as showing intact or lost junctions, indicating that calyceal junction dismantlement is triggered on a calyx-by-calyx basis. Chronic toxicity also altered the presence of ribeye, PSD-95 and GluA2 puncta in the calyces. These synaptic alterations varied between the two types of calyx endings (formed by calyx-only or dimorphic afferents) and some persisted at the end of the washout period. The present data reveal new forms of plasticity of the calyx endings in adult mammals, including a robust capacity for rebuilding the calyceal junction. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the phenomena involved in progressive vestibular dysfunction and its potential recovery during and after ototoxic exposure.},

NGS allows massive parallel sequencing that affords maximal tumor genomic assessment. NGS approaches are different, and concern DNA and RNA analysis. DNA sequencing includes whole-genome, whole-exome, and targeted sequencing, which focuses on a selection of genes of interest for a specific disease. RNA sequencing facilitates the detection of alternative gene-spliced transcripts, posttranscriptional modifications, gene fusion, mutations/single-nucleotide polymorphisms, small and long noncoding RNAs, and changes in gene expression. Most applications are in the cancer research field, but lately NGS technology has been revolutionizing cancer molecular diagnostics, due to the many advantages it offers compared to traditional methods. There is greater knowledge on solid cancer diagnostics, and recent interest has been shown also in the field of hematologic cancer. In this review, we report the latest data on NGS diagnostic/predictive clinical applications in solid and hematologic cancers. Moreover, since the amount of NGS data produced is very large and their interpretation is very complex, we briefly discuss two bioinformatic aspects, variantcalling accuracy and copy-number variation detection, which are gaining a lot of importance in cancer-diagnostic assessment.},

We investigated whether the link between prenatal analgesic exposure and asthma/wheeze is specific to paracetamol, and whether it is causal or confounded.             Using linked Swedish health register data we investigated the relation between various prescribed analgesics in pregnancy and the risk of childhood asthma/wheeze in a population of 492{$\mkern1mu$}999, and used negative paternal control and sibling comparison approaches to explore unmeasured confounding.                            After controlling for potential confounders, prescribed opioids, antimigraine drugs and paracetamol were all positively associated with childhood asthma/wheeze risk at all ages (               e.g.               for asthma/wheeze at age 4\hspace{0.25em}years: adjusted OR 1.39 (95\% CI 1.30\textendash 1.49), 1.19 (95\% CI 1.01\textendash 1.40) and 1.47 (95\% CI 1.36\textendash 1.59) for opioids, antimigraine drugs and paracetamol, respectively). The results of the paternal control analysis did not suggest the presence of unmeasured confounding by genetics or shared environment. However, the sibling control analysis broadly suggested that associations between prenatal exposure to the analgesics and asthma/wheeze were confounded by specific maternal factors (               e.g.               for asthma/wheeze at age 4\hspace{0.25em}years: adjusted OR 0.91 (95\% CI 0.62\textendash 1.31), 0.50 (95\% CI 0.17\textendash 1.45) and 0.80 (95\% CI 0.50\textendash 1.29) for opioids, antimigraine drugs and paracetamol, respectively).                          We propose that analgesic use in pregnancy does not cause childhood asthma/wheeze and that the association is confounded by unmeasured factors that are intrinsic to the mother, such as chronic pain or anxiety.},

We chose dopamine receptor genes (DRD1 and DRD2), NCAM, and COMT as examples of genes with CpG islands around the promoter region, and serotonin receptor genes (HTR2A and HTR3A), HCRT, and DRD3 as genes without CpG islands. Methylation states were investigated in fetal brain, fetal liver, placenta, and in adult peripheral leukocytes from three individuals by Southern blot and bisulfite-modified DNA sequencing. A repetitive sequence, human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-K was also examined. All genes examined were almost completely unmethylated in brains. The genes with CpG islands were unmethylated regardless of their expression state. In contrast, genes without CpG islands showed various methylation patterns, which did not necessarily reflect the transcriptional activity of the genes. Most HERV-K loci were methylated, but some loci showed relatively low methylation in the placenta and liver. Interestingly, we found inter-individual differences in methylation levels in HTR2A and HCRT in the placenta and in some loci of HERV-K in the placenta and liver. The sample with the lowest methylation levels in the two unique genes showed higher methylation of HERV-K loci than the other samples. These results provide detailed information about the methylation states of the genes analyzed and evidence for inter-individual variations in methylation in both unique and repetitive sequences.},

DNA methylation was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarrays and verified via pyrosequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Functional enrichment analysis were constructed by gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis based on the differentially methylated regions between LGA and AGA groups.Clinical investigation showed that LGA newborns had significantly lower hemoglobin and blood glucose compared to AGA newborns. Birth weight was negatively correlated to hemoglobin and blood glucose. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis identified 17 244 methylation variable positions achieving genome-wide significance (adjusted P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}.05). 34\% methylation variable positions were located in the gene promoter region. A total of 117 differentially methylated regions were revealed by bump hunting analysis, which mapped to 107 genes. Function analysis showed 13 genes enriched in "adhesion and infection process, endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, calcium signaling pathway and transmembrane transport". Four genes linked to type II diabetes mellitus. Among the 13 genes, we selected GNAS and calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 G for independent verification of pyrosequencing, and the messenger ribonucleic acid levels of guanine nucleotide binding protein, calcium voltage-gated channel subunit alpha1 G, DECR1, and FK506 binding protein 11 were verified by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.DNA methylation variation and gene expression differences in placental samples were associated with LGA newborns, which linking the effect of intrauterine environment to regulation of the offspring's gene expression. Furthermore, pathway analysis suggested that intrauterine environment affecting fetal growth might had a functional impact on multiple signaling pathways involved in fetal growth, metabolism, and inflammation. Further studies were required to understand the differences of methylation patterns.},

There is a strong interest in analyzing the DNA methylation data to find how to distinguish different subtypes of the tumor. However, the conventional statistical methods are not suitable for analyzing the highly dimensional DNA methylation data with bounded support. In order to explicitly capture the properties of the data, we design a deep neural network, which composes of several stacked binary restricted Boltzmann machines, to learn the low-dimensional deep features of the DNA methylation data. Experimental results show that these features perform best in breast cancer DNA methylation data cluster analysis, compared with some state-of-the-art methods.},

Validated analytical methods to measure trace concentrations of phthalate metabolites in humans are essential for assessing exposure to phthalates. Previously, we developed a sensitive and accurate automated analytical method for measuring up to 16 phthalate metabolites in human urine by using on-line solid phase extraction coupled with isotope dilution\textendash high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\textendash electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. To include the measurement of seven additional analytes, including oxidative metabolites of diisononyl and diisodecyl phthalates, two chemicals used extensively in numerous consumer products, we used a novel nontraditional HPLC solvent gradient program. With this approach, we achieved adequate resolution and sensitivity for all 22 analytes with limits of detection in the low ng/mL range, without increasing the analytical run time. The method also has high accuracy with automatic recovery correction, high precision, and excellent sample throughput with minimal matrix effects. Although it is possible to measure these 22 phthalate metabolites with adequate precision and accuracy at sub-parts-per-billion levels, additional information, including toxicokinetic data, is needed to demonstrate the usefulness of these phthalate metabolites for exposure assessment purposes .},

  abstract = {The exposome concept was defined in 2005 as encompassing all environmental exposures from conception onwards, as a new strategy to evidence environmental disease risk factors. Although very appealing, the exposome concept is challenging in many respects. In terms of assessment, several hundreds of time-varying exposures need to be considered, but increasing the number of exposures assessed should not be done at the cost of increased exposure misclassification. Accurately assessing the exposome currently requires numerous measurements, which rely on different technologies; resulting in an expensive set of protocols. In the future, high-throughput 'omics technologies may be a promising technique to integrate a wide range of exposures from a small numbers of biological matrices. Assessing the association between many exposures and health raises statistical challenges. Due to the correlation structure of the exposome, existing statistical methods cannot fully and efficiently untangle the exposures truly affecting the health outcome from correlated exposures. Other statistical challenges relate to accounting for exposure misclassification or identifying synergistic effects between exposures. On-going exposome projects are trying to overcome technical and statistical challenges. From a public health perspective, a better understanding of the environmental risk factors should open the way to improved prevention strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The widespread detection of perfluoroalkyl acids and their derivatives in wildlife and humans, and their entry into the immature brain, raise increasing concern about whether these agents might be developmental neurotoxicants. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) in undifferentiated and differentiating PC12 cells, a neuronotypic line used to characterize neurotoxicity. METHODS: We assessed inhibition of DNA synthesis, deficits in cell numbers and growth, oxidative stress, reduced cell viability, and shifts in differentiation toward or away from the dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) neurotransmitter phenotypes. RESULTS: In general, the rank order of adverse effects was PFOSA {$>$} PFOS {$>$} PFBS {$\approx$} PFOA. However, superimposed on this scheme, the various agents differed in their underlying mechanisms and specific outcomes. Notably, PFOS promoted differentiation into the ACh phenotype at the expense of the DA phenotype, PFBS suppressed differentiation of both phenotypes, PFOSA enhanced differentiation of both, and PFOA had little or no effect on phenotypic specification. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that all perfluorinated chemicals are not the same in their impact on neurodevelopment and that it is unlikely that there is one simple, shared mechanism by which they all produce their effects. Our results reinforce the potential for in vitro models to aid in the rapid and cost-effective screening for comparative effects among different chemicals in the same class and in relation to known developmental neurotoxicants.},

In contrast, transcription from SGCE remained unchanged throughout pregnancy, suggesting two neighboring imprinted genes are differentially regulated at very early pregnancy. Additionally, accumulation of two major species of mRNA (8 kb and 3.1 kb) encoded by HERV-W in placenta is regulated: 3.1 kb mRNA level remained unchanged throughout pregnancy, whereas the production of 8 kb species was highest in term placenta. Western blot and immunohistochemical staining of placental tissues with monoclonal antibodies revealed a marked reduction of syncytin glycoprotein synthesis in late pregnancy. Therefore, the relative levels of 3.1 kb and 8 kb mRNAs in trophoblasts could regulate syncytin protein synthesis, possibly by competition of the two mRNA species for translational apparatus.},

In all groups, the highest expression was detected for small noncoding RNAs and genes specifically implicated in placental function and hormonal regulation. The transcriptome of LO-PE placentas was clearly distinct, showing statistically significant (after FDR) expressional disturbances for hundreds of genes. Taqman RT-qPCR validation of 45 genes in an extended sample (n\,=\,24/group) provided concordant results. A limited number of transcription factors including LRF, SP1 and AP2 were identified as possible drivers of these changes. Notable differences were detected in differential expression signatures of LO-PE subtypes defined by the presence or absence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). LO-PE with IUGR showed higher correlation with SGA and LO-PE without IUGR with LGA placentas. Whereas changes in placental transcriptome in SGA, LGA and GD cases were less prominent, the overall profiles of expressional disturbances overlapped among pregnancy complications providing support to shared placental responses.

DNA methylation was assessed by 450K and EPIC using whole blood from newborn (n = 109) and 14-year-old (n = 86) participants of the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas. The overall per-sample correlations were very high (r {$>$}0.99), although many individual CpG sites, especially those with low variance of methylation, had lower correlations (median r = 0.24). There was also a small subset of CpGs with large mean methylation {$\beta$}-value differences between platforms, in both the newborn and 14-year datasets. However, estimates of cell type proportion prediction by 450K and EPIC were highly correlated at both ages. Finally, differentially methylated positions between boys and girls replicated very well by both platforms in newborns and older children. These findings are encouraging for application of combined data from EPIC and 450K platforms for birth cohorts and other population studies. These data in children corroborate recent comparisons of the two BeadChips in adults and in cancer cell lines. However, researchers should be cautious when characterizing individual CpG sites and consider independent methods for validation of significant hits.},

  abstract = {An increasing body of evidence points to significant spatio-temporal differences in early placental development between mouse and human, but a detailed comparison of placentae in these two species is missing. We set out to compare placentae from both species across gestation, with a focus on trophoblast progenitor markers. We found that CDX2 and ELF5, but not EOMES, are expressed in early postimplantation trophoblast subpopulations in both species. Genomewide expression profiling of mouse and human placentae revealed clusters of genes with distinct co-expression patterns across gestation. Overall, there was a closer fit between patterns observed in the placentae when the inter-species comparison was restricted to human placentae through gestational week 16 (thus, excluding fullterm samples), suggesting that the developmental timeline in mouse runs parallel to the first half of human placental development. In addition, we identified VGLL1 as a human-specific marker of proliferative cytotrophoblast, where it is co-expressed with the transcription factor TEAD4. As TEAD4 is involved in trophectoderm specification in the mouse, we posit a regulatory role for VGLL1 in early events during human placental development.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that the canonical Wnt pathway involving nuclear recruitment of {$\beta$}-catenin and activation of Wnt-dependent transcription factors is also critically involved in development and differentiation of the diverse reproductive tissues. Here, we summarise our present knowledge about expression, regulation and function of Wnt ligands and their frizzled receptors in murine and human endometrial and placental cell types. In mice, Wnt signalling promotes early trophoblast lineage development, blastocyst activation, implantation and chorion\textendash allantois fusion. Moreover, different Wnt ligands play essential roles in the development of the murine uterine tract, in cycling endometrial cells and during decidualisation. In humans, estrogen-dependent endometrial cell proliferation, decidualisation, trophoblast attachment and invasion were shown to be controlled by the particular signalling pathway. Failures in Wnt signalling are associated with infertility, endometriosis, endometrial cancer and gestational diseases such as complete mole placentae and choriocarcinomas. However, our present knowledge is still scarce due to the complexity of the Wnt network involving numerous ligands, receptors and non-canonical pathways. Hence, much remains to be learned about the role of different Wnt signalling cascades in reproductive cell types and their changes under pathological conditions.},

  abstract = {Background We, and others, have demonstrated previously that there are differences in DNA methylation and transcript levels of a number of genes in cord blood and placenta between children conceived using assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and children conceived in vivo. The source of these differences (the effect of ART versus the underlying infertility) has never been determined in humans. In this study, we have attempted to resolve this issue by comparing placental DNA methylation levels at 37 CpG sites in 16 previously identified candidate genes in independent populations of children conceived in vivo (`fertile control' group) with ART children conceived from two groups: either autologous oocytes with infertility in one or both parents (`infertile ART' group) or donor oocytes (obtained from young fertile donors) without male infertility (`donor oocyte ART' group). Results Of the 37 CpG sites analyzed, significant differences between the three groups were found in 11 CpGs (29.73 \%), using ANOVA. Tukey's post hoc test on the significant results indicated that seven (63.63 \%) of these differences were significant between the donor oocyte ART and fertile control groups. In addition, 20 of the 37 CpGs analyzed had been identified as differentially methylated between ART and fertile control groups in an independent population in a prior study. Of these 20 CpG sites, 9 also showed significant differences in the present population. An additional 9 CpGs were found to be significantly different between the two groups. Of these 18 candidate CpGs, 12 CpGs (in seven candidate genes) also showed significant differences in placental DNA methylation levels between the donor oocyte ART and fertile control groups. Conclusions These data suggest strongly that the DNA methylation differences observed between ART and in vivo conceptions are associated with some aspect of ART protocols, not simply the underlying infertility.

TCS exposure has been found to cause developmental abnormalities and endocrine disruption in various species of fish. It is not clearly understood whether TCS exposure causes epigenetic alterations in developing embryos and their germ cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of TCS exposure (0, 50, 100 and, 200~{$\mu$}g/L) on embryonic development and primordial germ cells (PGCs), which are precursors of sperm and eggs, in medaka (Oyzias latipes). Developmental TCS exposure from 8~h post-fertilization through 15 days post-fertilization (dpf) resulted in several developmental abnormalities, including enlarged yolk sac, decreased head trunk angle (HTA), and severe edema in the pericardial region. The male ratio increased in the 100~{$\mu$}g/L TCS exposure group, which was negatively correlated with the expression of cyp19ala (a gene encoding aromatase) and ar{$\alpha$} (androgen receptor alpha). Developmental 50~{$\mu$}g/L TCS exposure resulted in global hypomethylation in the whole body but not in the isolated PGCs. Expression of the gene encoding DNA methyltransferases (dnmt1 and dnmt3aa) was decreased by 50~{$\mu$}g/L TCS exposure both in the whole body and PGCs. TCS altered the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in DNA methylation and demethylation in PGCs, suggesting epigenetic effects on germ cells. The present results demonstrate that the embryos exposed to the tested concentrations of TCS develop deformities during the early life stages and that the TCS within this range possesses endocrine disrupting properties potential enough to alter sex ratios of developing embryos.},

  abstract = {Benzophenone (BP)-type ultraviolet (UV) filters are widely used in personal care products. Some of them have been identified as endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, little is known about the occurrence of BP-type UV filters in paired maternal-fetal samples. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of eight BP-type UV filters in paired maternal-fetal samples collected from Southern China. Among target analytes, only benzophenone-3 (BP-3) was frequently (detection rate~{$>~$}80\%) detected in maternal-fetal samples, i.e., maternal serum (MS), cord serum (CS), maternal urine (MU) and amniotic fluid (AF). BP-3 was the dominant compound in MS (median: 0.14~ng/mL), CS (0.16) and AF (0.12); whereas MU was dominated by benzophenone-1 (BP-1, 2.85). The median CS/MS ratios (i.e., placental transfer rates) of 4-hydroxy benzophenone (4-OH-BP, 2.35), BP-1 (1.52), benzophenone-4 (BP-4, 1.06), and BP-3 (1.03) were higher than 1.0, suggesting that exposure levels of these chemicals in fetuses were greater than those in mothers. Significant positive correlations (r~=~0.667, p~{$<~$}0.001) of BP-3 concentrations were found between MS and CS, which suggested that MS could be an indicator of fetal exposure to BP-3. Furthermore, the CS/MS ratios of 4-OH-BP, BP-1, BP-3, and benzophenone-8 (BP-8) increased with decreasing molecular weight or log Kow. Passive diffusion may play an important role in placental transfer of these BP type UV filters. The MU/MSBP-3 ratio (5.86) was relatively higher than that of MU/MSBP-1 (0.89), which indicated that BP-3 excretes rapidly in urine. The present study documents the occurrence of eight BP-type UV filters in matched MS, CS, MU and AF samples for the first time in China.},

An important potential limitation of these observational studies is confounding by indication. Objectives We investigated the association of antipyretic intake, 1) during pregnancy and 2) during the first year of life (infancy), with asthma-related outcomes, before and after controlling for early life respiratory infections. Methods We included 1490 mother-child pairs in Project Viva, a longitudinal pre-birth cohort study. We categorized prenatal acetaminophen exposure as the maximum intake (never, 1\textendash 9 or {$\geq$} 10 times) in early or mid-pregnancy, and ibuprofen intake as presence or absence in early pregnancy. We expressed intakes of antipyretics in infancy as never, 1\textendash 5, 6\textendash 10, or {$>$}10 times. We examined the associations of acetaminophen and ibuprofen (per unit increase in exposure category) during pregnancy and infancy with wheeze, asthma and allergen sensitization in early (3\textendash 5 y) (n= 1419) and mid-childhood (7\textendash 10 y) (n= 1220). Results Unadjusted models showed an elevated asthma risk in early childhood for higher infant acetaminophen (OR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.04, 1.41) and ibuprofen (OR 1.35, 95\% CI 1.19, 1.52) intake. Controlling for respiratory infections attenuated estimates for acetaminophen (OR 1.03, 95\% CI 0.88, 1.22) and ibuprofen (OR 1.19, 95\% CI 1.05, 1.36). Prenatal acetaminophen was associated with increased asthma (OR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.02, 1.58) in early but not mid-childhood. Conclusions Adjustment for respiratory infections in early life substantially diminished associations between infant antipyretics and early childhood asthma. Respiratory infections should be accounted for in studies of antipyretics and asthma, to mitigate bias due to confounding by indication.},

  abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that early exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals has long-term consequences that can influence disease risk in offspring. During gametogenesis, imprinted genes are reasonable epigenetic targets with the ability to retain and transfer environmental messages. We hypothesized that exposures to organophosphate (OP) flame-retardants can alter DNA methylation in human sperm cells affecting offspring's health. Sperm and urine samples were collected from 67 men in North Carolina, USA. Urinary metabolites of a chlorinated OP, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate, and two non-chlorinated OPs, triphenyl phosphate and mono-isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate, were measured using liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Sperm DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites of the regulatory differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of imprinted genes GRB10, H19, IGF2, MEG3, NDN, NNAT, PEG1/MEST, PEG3, PLAGL1, SNRPN, and SGCE/PEG10 was quantified using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Regression models were used to determine potential associations between OP concentrations and DNA methylation. We found that men with higher concentrations of urinary OP metabolites, known to originate from flame-retardants, have a slightly higher fraction of sperm cells that are aberrantly methylated. After adjusting for age, obesity-status and multiple testing, exposure to mono-isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate was significantly related to hypermethylation at the MEG3, NDN, SNRPN DMRs. Exposure to triphenyl phosphate was associated with hypermethylation at the GRB10 DMR; and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate exposure was associated with altered methylation at the MEG3 and H19 DMRs. Although measured methylation differences were small, implications for public health can be substantial. Interestingly, our data indicated that a multiplicity of OPs in the human body is associated with increased DNA methylation aberrancies in sperm, compared to exposure to few OPs. Further research is required in larger study populations to determine if our findings can be generalized.},

We observed an inverted J-shaped association between PFOA and ADHD, with a small increase in prevalence for the second quartile of exposure compared with the lowest, and a decrease for the highest versus lowest quartile. The prevalence of ADHD plus medication increased with perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) levels, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.59 (95\% confidence interval, 1.21\textendash 2.08) comparing the highest quartile of exposure to the lowest. We observed a modest association between perfluorooctane sulfonate and ADHD with medication. Conclusions: The most notable finding for PFOA and ADHD, a reduction in prevalence at the highest exposure level, is unlikely to be causal, perhaps reflecting a spurious finding related to the geographic determination of PFOA exposure in this population or to unmeasured behavioral or physiologic correlates of exposure and outcome. Possible positive associations between other PFCs and ADHD, particularly PFHxS, warrant continued investigation.},

  abstract = {The placenta guides fetal growth and development. Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are widespread environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors, and the placental epigenetic response to these chemicals is an area of growing research interest. Therefore, our objective was to summarize research linking BPA or phthalate exposure to placental outcomes in human pregnancies, with a particular focus on epigenetic endpoints. In PubMed, studies were selected for review (without limiting start date and ending on 1 May 2018) if they reported any direct effects of BPA or phthalates on the placenta in humans. Collectively, available studies suggest that BPA and phthalate exposures are associated with changes to placental micro-RNA expression, DNA methylation, and genomic imprinting. Furthermore, several studies suggest that fetal sex may be an important modifier of placental outcomes in response to these chemicals. Studies in humans demonstrate associations of BPA and phthalate exposure with adverse placental outcomes. Moving forward, more studies should consider sex differences (termed ``placental sex'') in the measured outcomes, and should utilize appropriate statistical approaches to assess modification by fetal sex. Furthermore, more consistent sample collection and molecular outcome assessment paradigms will be indispensable for making progress in the field. These advances, together with improved non-invasive tools for measuring placental function and outcomes across pregnancy, will be critical for understanding the mechanisms driving placental epigenetic disruption in response to BPA and phthalates, and how these disruptions translate into placental and fetal health.},

  abstract = {Results of the analyses of occupational and environmental samples are frequently reported as ``less than a specified value,'' a practice followed by many analytical laboratories. A left-censored distribution occurs when analytical laboratories do not report results that fall below their limits of detection or quantification. Approximately 37\% of the household interior dust lead loadings collected in a large-scale, multisite, longitudinal study of lead-based paint hazard controls were reported to be below the ``method detection limit.'' These unreported values are unusable in any statistical analysis of the data and must be replaced by a valid dust lead loading estimate, a process called data imputation. This investigation tested how well data imputed using a newly formulated procedure for estimating the data below the method detection limit were correlated with dust lead loadings reported by the participating laboratories after special request. These results were also compared with those obtained by imputing the minimum detectable level by the square root of 2. Imputation of the low lead loadings was accomplished by substituting the value associated with the median percentile below each laboratory's method detection limit. A correlation of r = 0.50 was calculated between the predicted and reported dust lead loadings, with only slight bias (2.9\%) in the predicted values. An alternative imputation procedure that used the predicted value from structural equation models fit to the noncensored dust lead loadings performed about as well, although the predictions had to be ``centered'' to correspond to the censored data. An estimator that combined both of these imputation procedures only slightly improved the correlation between the predicted and laboratory values (r = 0.51). These results support the use of the new procedure rather than the commonly used imputed values of the method detection limit divided by 2 or by the square root of 2. Imputing values based on either of these common approaches may result in much more biased predictions for the censored data; in the case of these data, the dust lead loadings were overestimated by 348\%. The results also suggest that analytical laboratories should provide a numerical result for all analyzed samples, with a ``flag'' of those values below their detection limit, since these results may be more accurate than any imputed value, particularly those provided by the commonly used method of dividing the minimum detection limit by the square root of 2.},

Thus, our aim is to develop an approach for reconstruction of the placental methylome, which should be completely noninvasive and achieve high accuracy and resolution. Results We propose a novel size-based algorithm, FEtal MEthylome Reconstructor (FEMER), to noninvasively reconstruct the placental methylome by genomewide bisulfite sequencing and size-based analysis of maternal plasma DNA. By applying FEMER on a real clinical dataset, we demonstrate that FEMER achieves both high accuracy and resolution, thus provides a high-quality view of the placental methylome from maternal plasma DNA. FEtal MEthylome Reconstructor could also predict the DNA methylation profile of CpG islands with high accuracy, thus shows potential in monitoring of key genes involved in placental/fetal development. Source code and testing datasets for FEMER are available at http://sunlab.cpy.cuhk.edu.hk/FEMER/. Conclusion FEtal MEthylome Reconstructor could enhance the noninvasive fetal/placental methylomic analysis and facilitate its application in prenatal testing and monitoring.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia, a pregnancy complication of placental origin is associated with altered expression of angiogenic factors and their receptors. Recently, there is considerable interest in understanding the role of adverse intrauterine conditions in placental dysfunction and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Since we have observed changes in placental global DNA methylation levels in preeclampsia, this study was undertaken to examine gene promoter CpG methylation and expression of several angiogenic genes.We recruited 139 women comprising, 46 normotensive women with term delivery ({$\geq$}37 weeks), 45 women with preeclampsia delivering preterm ({$<$}37 weeks) and 48 women with preeclampsia delivering at term. Expression levels and promoter CpG methylation of VEGF, FLT-1 and KDR genes in placentae from respective groups were determined by Taqman-based quantitative real time PCR and by the Sequenom\textregistered{} EpiTYPER\texttrademark{} technology respectively. RESULTS: We observed several differentially methylated CpG sites in the promoter regions of VEGF, FLT-1 and KDR between the normotensive and preeclampsia groups. We specifically observed hypomethylated CpGs in the promoter region and an increased expression of VEGF gene between term and preterm preeclampsia. However, mean promoter CpG methylation could not account for the higher expression of FLT-1 and KDR in preterm preeclampsia as compared to normotensive group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicates altered DNA methylation patterns in the VEGF, FLT-1 and KDR genes in preeclampsia as compared to the normotensive group, which could be involved in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Hypomethylation of VEGF promoter and consequent upregulation of VEGF mRNA levels could be a compensatory mechanism to restore normal angiogenesis and blood flow in preterm preeclampsia. This study suggests a role of altered DNA methylation in placental angiogenesis and in determining adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

  abstract = {Exposure to endocrine disruptors is associated with developmental defects. One compound of concern, to which humans are widely exposed, is bisphenol A (BPA). In model organisms, BPA exposure is linked to metabolic disorders, infertility, cancer, and behavior anomalies. Recently, BPA exposure has been linked to DNA methylation changes, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms may be relevant. We investigated effects of exposure on genomic imprinting in the mouse as imprinted genes are regulated by differential DNA methylation and aberrant imprinting disrupts fetal, placental, and postnatal development. Through allele-specific and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, we demonstrated that maternal BPA exposure during late stages of oocyte development and early stages of embryonic development significantly disrupted imprinted gene expression in embryonic day (E) 9.5 and 12.5 embryos and placentas. The affected genes included Snrpn, Ube3a, Igf2, Kcnq1ot1, Cdkn1c, and Ascl2; mutations and aberrant regulation of these genes are associated with imprinting disorders in humans. Furthermore, the majority of affected genes were expressed abnormally in the placenta. DNA methylation studies showed that BPA exposure significantly altered the methylation levels of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) including the Snrpn imprinting control region (ICR) and Igf2 DMR1. Moreover, exposure significantly reduced genome-wide methylation levels in the placenta, but not the embryo. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that these epigenetic defects were associated with abnormal placental development. In contrast to this early exposure paradigm, exposure outside of the epigenetic reprogramming window did not cause significant imprinting perturbations. Our data suggest that early exposure to common environmental compounds has the potential to disrupt fetal and postnatal health through epigenetic changes in the embryo and abnormal development of the placenta.},

METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples from 28 MZ twin pairs discordant for RA. DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChips. Smoking, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and immunosuppressive treatment were included as covariates. Pathway analysis was performed using GREAT. RESULTS: Smoking was significantly associated with hypomethylation of a DMR overlapping the promoter region of the RNF5 and the AGPAT1, which are implicated in inflammation and autoimmunity, whereas DMARD treatment induced hypermethylation of the same region. Additionally, the promotor region of both S100A6 and EFCAB4B were hypomethylated, and both genes have previously been associated with RA. We replicated several candidate genes identified in a previous EWAS in treatment-na\"ive RA singletons. Gene-set analysis indicated the involvement of immunologic signatures and cancer-related pathways in RA. CONCLUSION: We identified several differentially methylated regions associated with RA, which may represent environmental effects or consequences of the disease and plausible biological pathways pertinent to the pathogenesis of RA.},

Depending on the targeted cell types, tissues and organs, these signals modulate diverse physiological functions. The basic schemes of heterotrimeric G-proteins have been outlined. In this review we briefly summarize what is known about the regulation, signaling and physiological functions of G-proteins. We then focus on a few less explored areas such as regulation of G-proteins by non-GPCRs, and the physiological functions of G-proteins that can not be easily explained by the known G-protein signaling pathways. There are new signaling pathways and physiological functions for G-proteins to be discovered and further interrogated. With the advancements in structural and computational biological techniques, we are closer to having a better understanding of how G-proteins are regulated, and the specificity of G-protein interactions with their regulators.,},

  abstract = {STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Are the placental aquaporins (AQPs) involved in the apoptosis of human trophoblast? STUDY FINDING: The general blocking of placental AQPs with HgCl2 and, in particular, the blocking of AQP3 activity with CuSO4 abrogated the apoptotic events of human trophoblast cells. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Although apoptosis of trophoblast cells is a natural event involved in the normal development of the placenta, it is exacerbated in pathological processes, such as pre-eclampsia, where an abnormal expression and functionality of placental AQPs occur without alterations in the feto-maternal water flux. Furthermore, fluctuations in O2 tension are proposed to be a potent inducer of placental apoptotic changes and, in explants exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), transcellular water transport mediated by AQPs was undetectable. This suggests that AQPs might be involved in processes other than water transport, such as apoptosis. STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: Explants from normal term placentas were maintained in culture under conditions of normoxia, hypoxia and H/R. Cell viability was determined by assessing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide incorporation. For the general or specific inhibition of AQPs, 0.3 mM HgCl2, 5 mM CuSO4, 0.3 mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) or 0.5 mM phloretin were added to the culture medium before explants were exposed to each treatment. Oxidative stress parameters and apoptotic indexes were evaluated in the presence or absence of AQPs blockers. AQP3 expression was confirmed by western blot and immunohistochemistry. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: First, we observed that in H/R treatments cell viability decreased by 20.16 {$\pm$} 5.73\% compared with those explants cultured in normoxia (P = 0.009; n = 7). Hypoxia did not modify cell viability significantly. Both hypoxia and H/R conditions induced oxidative stress. Spontaneous chemiluminescence and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels were significantly increased in explants exposed to hypoxia (n = 6 per group, P = 0.0316 and P = 0.0009, respectively) and H/R conditions (n = 6 per group, P = 0.0281 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with those cultured in normoxia. Regarding apoptosis, H/R was a more potent inducer of trophoblast apoptosis than hypoxia alone. Bax expression and the number of apoptotic nuclei were significantly higher in explants cultured in H/R compared with normoxia and hypoxia conditions (n = 12, P = 0.0135 and P = 0.001, respectively). DNA fragmentation was only observed in H/R and, compared with normoxia and hypoxia, the activity of caspase-3 was highest in explants cultured in H/R (n = 12, P = 0.0001). In explants exposed to H/R, steric blocking of AQP activity with HgCl2 showed that DNA degradation was undetectable (n = 12, P = 0.001). Bax expression and caspase-3 activity were drastically reduced (n = 12, P = 0.0146 and P = 0.0001, respectively) compared with explants cultured in H/R but not treated with HgCl2. Similar results were observed in explants exposed to H/R when we blocked AQP3 activity with CuSO4. DNA degradation was undetectable and the number of apoptotic nuclei and caspase-3 activity were significantly decreased compared with explants cultured in H/R but not treated with CuSO4 (n = 12, P = 0.001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). However, TEA and phloretin treatments, to block AQP1/4 or AQP9, respectively, failed in abrogate apoptosis. In addition, we confirmed the expression and localization of AQP3 in explants exposed to H/R. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our studies are limited by the number of experimental conditions tested, which do not fully capture the variability in oxygen levels, duration of exposure and alternating patterns of oxygen seen in vivo. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that any alteration in placental AQP expression might disturb the equilibrium of the normal apoptotic events and may be an underlying cause in the pathophysiology of placental gestational disorders such as pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, the dysregulation of placental AQPs may be one of the crucial factors in triggering the clinical manifestations of pre-eclampsia. LARGE SCALE DATA: n/a.

Here, we aimed to describe the early-life exposome. Specifically, we focused on the correlations between multiple environmental exposures, their patterns and their variability across European regions and across time (pregnancy and childhood periods). We relied on the Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project, in which 87 environmental exposures during pregnancy and 122 during the childhood period (grouped in 19 exposure groups) were assessed in 1301 pregnant mothers and their children at 6\textendash 11 years in 6 European birth cohorts. Some correlations between exposures in the same exposure group reached high values above 0.8. The median correlation within exposure groups was {$>$} 0.3 for many exposure groups, reaching 0.69 for water disinfection by products in pregnancy and 0.67 for the meteorological group in childhood. Median correlations between different exposure groups rarely reached 0.3. Some correlations were driven by cohort-level associations (e.g. air pollution and chemicals). Ten principal components explained 45\% and 39\% of the total variance in the pregnancy and childhood exposome, respectively, while 65 and 90 components were required to explain 95\% of the exposome variability. Correlations between maternal (pregnancy) and childhood exposures were high ({$>$} 0.6) for most exposures modeled at the residential address (e.g. air pollution), but were much lower and even close to zero for some chemical exposures.},

  abstract = {Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous substances that interfere with the stability and regulation of the endocrine system of the body or its offspring. These substances are generally stable in chemical properties, not easy to be biodegraded, and can be enriched in organisms. In the past half century, EDCs have gradually entered the food chain, and these substances have been frequently found in maternal blood. Perinatal maternal hormone levels are unstable and vulnerable to EDCs. Some EDCs can affect embryonic development through the blood-fetal barrier and cause damage to the neuroendocrine system, liver function, and genital development. Some also effect cross-generational inheritance through epigenetic mechanisms. This article mainly elaborates the mechanism and detection methods of estrogenic endocrine disruptors, such as bisphenol A (BPA), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), diethylstilbestrol (DES) and phthalates (PAEs), and their effects on placenta and fetal health in order to raise concerns about the proper use of products containing EDCs during pregnancy and provide a reference for human health.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics with the ability to interfere with hormone action, even at low levels. Prior environmental epidemiology studies link numerous suspected EDCs, including phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, results for some chemicals were inconsistent and most assessed one chemical at a time. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the overall impact of prenatal exposure to an EDC mixture on neurodevelopment in school-aged children, and identify chemicals of concern while accounting for co-exposures. METHODS: Among 718 mother-child pairs from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal, Mother and child, Asthma and allergy study (SELMA) study, we used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to assess the association between 26 EDCs measured in 1st trimester urine or blood, with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (IV) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 7 years. Models were adjusted for child sex, gestational age, mother's education, mother's IQ (RAVEN), weight, and smoking status. To evaluate generalizability, we conducted repeated holdout validation, a machine learning technique. RESULTS: Using repeated holdout validation, IQ scores were 1.9-points (CI = -3.6, -0.2) lower among boys for an inter-quartile-range (IQR) change in the WQS index. BPF made the largest contribution to the index with a weight of 14\%. Other chemicals of concern and their weights included PBA (9\%), TCP (9\%), MEP (6\%), MBzP (4\%), PFOA (6\%), PFOS (5\%), PFHxS (4\%), Triclosan (5\%), and BPA (4\%). While we did observe an inverse association between EDCs and IQ among all children when training and testing the WQS index estimate on the full dataset, these results were not robust to repeated holdout validation. CONCLUSION: Among boys, early prenatal exposure to EDCs was associated with lower intellectual functioning at age 7. We identified bisphenol F as the primary chemical of concern, suggesting that the BPA replacement compound may not be any safer for children. Future studies are needed to confirm the potential neurotoxicity of replacement analogues.},

If present in excess, free copper ions can cause damage to cellular components and a delicate balance between the uptake and efflux of copper ions determines the amount of cellular copper. In biological systems, copper homeostasis has been characterized at the molecular level.

The primary objective of the workshop was to identify and compare different statistical approaches and methods for analyzing complex chemical mixtures data in both simulated and real-world data sets. At the workshop, participants compared approaches and results and speculated as to why they may have differed. Several themes emerged: a) no one statistical approach appeared to outperform the others, b) many methods included some form of variable reduction or summation of the data before statistical analysis, c) the statistical approach should be selected based upon a specific hypothesis or scientific question, and d) related mixtures data should be shared among researchers to more comprehensively and accurately address methodological questions and statistical approaches. Future efforts should continue to design and optimize statistical approaches to address questions about chemical mixtures in epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The Illumina Infinium 450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely different DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to adjust for the two different probe designs., Results: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normalization strategy for 450 k data, called BMIQ (Beta MIxture Quantile dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a statistical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favourably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for any study using the Illumina Infinium 450 k platform., Availability: BMIQ is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/bmiq/., Contact: a.teschendorff@ucl.ac.uk, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online},

  abstract = {A major challenge faced by epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) is cell-type heterogeneity. As many EWAS have already demonstrated, adjusting for changes in cell-type composition can be critical when analyzing and interpreting findings from such studies. Because of their importance, a great number of different statistical algorithms, which adjust for cell-type composition, have been proposed. Some of the methods are `reference based' in that they require a priori defined reference DNA methylation profiles of cell types that are present in the tissue of interest, while other algorithms are `reference free.' At present, however, it is unclear how best to adjust for cell-type heterogeneity, as this may also largely depend on the type of tissue and phenotype being considered. Here, we provide a critical review of the major existing algorithms for correcting cell-type composition in the context of Illumina Infinium Methylation Beadarrays, with the aim of providing useful recommendations to the EWAS community.},

  abstract = {Background: Intra-sample cellular heterogeneity presents numerous challenges to the identification of biomarkers in large Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS). While a number of reference-based deconvolution algorithms have emerged, their potential remains underexplored and a comparative evaluation of these algorithms beyond tissues such as blood is still lacking. Results: Here we present a novel framework for reference-based inference, which leverages cell-type specific DNAse Hypersensitive Site (DHS) information from the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap to construct an improved reference DNA methylation database. We show that this leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement of cell-count estimates in whole blood as well as in mixtures involving epithelial cell-types. Using this framework we compare a widely used state-of-the-art reference-based algorithm (called constrained projection) to two non-constrained approaches including CIBERSORT and a method based on robust partial correlations. We conclude that the widely-used constrained projection technique may not always be optimal. Instead, we find that the method based on robust partial correlations is generally more robust across a range of different tissue types and for realistic noise levels. We call the combined algorithm which uses DHS data and robust partial correlations for inference, EpiDISH (Epigenetic Dissection of Intra-Sample Heterogeneity). Finally, we demonstrate the added value of EpiDISH in an EWAS of smoking. Conclusions: Estimating cell-type fractions and subsequent inference in EWAS may benefit from the use of nonconstrained reference-based cell-type deconvolution methods.},

  abstract = {Counter-intuitively, over-the-counter medication is commonly taken by pregnant women. In this context, acetaminophen (APAP, e.g. Paracetamol, Tylenol) is generally recommended by physicians to treat fever and pain during pregnancy. Thus, APAP ranks at the top of the list of medications taken prenatally. Insights on an increased risk for pregnancy complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth or fetal malformations upon APAP exposure are rather ambiguous. However, emerging evidence arising from human trials clearly reveals a significant correlation between APAP use during pregnancy and an increased risk for the development of asthma in children later in life. Pathways through which APAP increases this risk are still elusive. APAP can be liver toxic and since APAP appears to freely cross the placenta, therapeutic and certainly toxic doses could not only affect maternal, but also fetal hepatocytes. It is noteworthy that during fetal development, the liver transiently functions as the main hematopoietic organ. We here review the effect of APAP on metabolic and immunological parameters in pregnant women and on fetal development and immune ontogeny in order to delineate novel, putative and to date underrated pathways through which APAP use during pregnancy can impair maternal, fetal and long term children's health. We conclude that future studies are urgently needed to reconsider the safety and dosage of APAP during pregnancy and \textendash{} based on the advances made in the field of reproduction as well as APAP metabolism \textendash{} we propose pathways, which should be addressed in future research and clinical endeavors.},

Methods Participants were members of the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study, a longitudinal study of 871 infants of European descent sampled disproportionately for small for gestational age. Drug use during pregnancy (acetaminophen, aspirin, antacids, and antibiotics) were analysed in relation to behavioural difficulties and ADHD symptoms measured by parent report at age 7 and both parent- and child-report at 11 years of age. The analyses included multiple covariates including birthweight, socioeconomic status and antenatal maternal perceived stress. Results Acetaminophen was used by 49.8\% of the study mothers during pregnancy. We found significantly higher total difficulty scores (Strengths and Difficulty Questionnaire parent report at age 7 and child report at age 11) if acetaminophen was used during pregnancy, but there were no significant differences associated with any of the other drugs. Children of mothers who used acetaminophen during pregnancy were also at increased risk of ADHD at 7 and 11 years of age (Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised). Conclusions These findings strengthen the contention that acetaminophen exposure in pregnancy increases the risk of ADHD-like behaviours. Our study also supports earlier claims that findings are specific to acetaminophen.},

However, little is known about the behavioral and neurochemical effects of BPA exposure. This study examined whether chronic daily exposure to an environmental endocrine-disrupting chemical, bisphenol A [(BPA); 100 microg/kg/day or 500 microg/kg/day, p.o.], from prenatal Day 7 to postnatal Day 36 would lead to changes in anxiety and memory in mice. First, we observed the behavioral alterations of BPA-treated mice using two anxiety-related models, the open field test and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. In the open field test, BPA treatment (100 microg/kg/day) increased movement in the central zone. BPA treatment (500 microg/kg/day) also increased the time spent in the open arms in the EPM test. Second, we measured cognitive ability in the Y-maze test and novel object test. BPA-treated mice showed decreased alternation behavior in the Y-maze at both of doses, indicating working memory impairment. BPA-treated mice (100 microg/kg/day) also showed decreased novel object recognition as expressed by central locomotion and frequency in the central zone, showing recognition memory impairment. Finally, to measure changes in the dopaminergic and NMDAergic systems in the brain, we performed autoradiographic receptor binding assays for dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, the NMDA receptor, and the dopamine transporter. BPA treatment increased D(2) receptor binding in the caudate putamen (CPu) but decreased DAT binding. BPA treatment also decreased NMDA receptor binding in the frontal cortex and CA1, CA3, and DG of the hippocampus. Taken together, our results suggest that long-term BPA exposure in mice can induce anxiolytic behaviors, cognitive deficits and changes in the dopaminergic and NMDAergic systems.},

DNA methylation is a potential mechanism underlying the impacts of environmental exposures on fetal development; however, very few studies have been done elucidating the role of DNA methylation linking prenatal Se and child neurobehavior. We aimed to investigate the associations between placental Se concentration and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in two U.S. cohorts, and to assess the association between Serelated DNA methylation modifications and newborns' neurobehavior. Methods: We measured placental Se concentrations in 343 newborns enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study and in 141 newborns in the Rhode Island Child Health Study. Genome-wide placental DNA methylation was measured by HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and newborn neurobehavioral development was assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS). We meta-analyzed the associations between placental Se concentration and DNA methylation in each cohort, adjusting for covariates. We also fit multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression for methylation and newborn NNNS summary scores. Results: We identified five Se-related differentially methylated CpG sites. Among them was cg09674502 (GFI1), where selenium concentration was positively associated with methylation ({$\beta$}-coefficient = 1.11, FDR-adjusted pvalue = 0.045), and where we observed that a one percent methylation level increase was associated with a 15\% reduced odds of higher muscle tone in the arms, legs and trunk of newborns, (OR [95\% Confidence Interval, CI] = 0.85 [0.77, 0.95]). We also observed for each interquartile range (IQR) increase in selenium concentration in the placenta, there was 1.76 times greater odds of higher hypotonicity (OR [95\% CI] = 1.76 [1.12, 2.82]). Conclusions: Placental selenium concentration was inversely associated with muscle tone of newborns, and hypermethylation of GFI1 could be a potential mechanism underlying this association.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.]},

  abstract = {Background The placenta is the central regulator of maternal and fetal interactions. Perturbations of placental structure and function have been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes later in life. Placental CpG methylation represents an epigenetic modification with the potential to impact placental function, fetal development and child health later in life. Study design Genome-wide placental CpG methylation levels were compared between spontaneous versus indicated deliveries from extremely preterm births (EPTBs) (n = 84). The association between the identified differentially methylated CpG sites and neurocognitive outcome at ten years of age was then evaluated. Results Spontaneous EPTB was associated with differential CpG methylation levels in 250 CpG sites (217 unique genes) with the majority displaying hypermethylation. The identified genes are known to play a role in neurodevelopment and are enriched for basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor binding sites. The placental CpG methylation levels for 17 of these sites predicted cognitive function at ten years of age. Conclusion A hypermethylation signature is present in DNA from placentas in infants with spontaneous EPTB. CpG methylation levels of critical neurodevelopment genes in the placenta predicted later life cognitive function, supporting the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis (DOHaD).},

We compared DNAm in breast tumors with normal-adjacent breast samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We constructed models stratified by tumor stage and PAM50 molecular subtype and performed cell-type reference-free deconvolution on each model. We identified nineteen differentially methylated gene regions (DMGRs) in early stage tumors across eleven genes (             AGRN, C1orf170, FAM41C, FLJ39609, HES4, ISG15, KLHL17, NOC2L, PLEKHN1, SAMD11, WASH5P             ). These regions were consistently differentially methylated in every subtype and all implicated genes are localized on chromosome 1p36.3. We also validated seventeen DMGRs in an independent data set. Identification and validation of shared DNAm alterations across tumor subtypes in early stage tumors advances our understanding of common biology underlying breast carcinogenesis and may contribute to biomarker development. We also provide evidence on the importance and potential function of 1p36 in cancer.},

Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to underlie these associations. Indeed, animal studies and our early human data on the imprinted IGF2 locus indicated a link between prenatal nutritional and DNA methylation. However, it remains unclear how common changes in DNA methylation are and whether they are sex- and timing-specific paralleling the later-life consequences of prenatal famine exposure. To this end, we investigated the methylation of 15 loci implicated in growth and metabolic disease in individuals who were prenatally exposed to a war-time famine in 1944\textendash 45. Methylation of INSIGF was lower among individuals who were periconceptionally exposed to the famine (n = 60) compared with their unexposed same-sex siblings (P = 2 \texttimes{} 10-5), whereas methylation of IL10, LEP, ABCA1, GNASAS and MEG3 was higher (all P {$<$} 10-3). A significant interaction with sex was observed for INSIGF, LEP and GNASAS. Next, methylation of eight representative loci was compared between 62 individuals exposed late in gestation and their unexposed siblings. Methylation was different for GNASAS (P = 1.1 \texttimes{} 10-7) and, in men, LEP (P = 0.017). Our data indicate that persistent changes in DNA methylation may be a common consequence of prenatal famine exposure and that these changes depend on the sex of the exposed individual and the gestational timing of the exposure.},

Both associations have been hypothesized to involve epigenetic mechanisms. We investigated whether prenatal growth restriction early in pregnancy was associated with changes in DNA methylation at loci that were previously shown to be sensitive to early gestational famine exposure. We compared 38 individuals born preterm ({$<$}32 weeks) and with a birth weight too low for their gestational age (less than -1SDS; SGA) with 75 individuals born preterm but with a birth weight appropriate for their gestational age (greater than -1SDS) and a normal postnatal growth (greater than -1SDS at three months post term; AGA). The SGA individuals were not only lighter at birth, but also had a smaller length (p = 3.3 \texttimes{} 10-13) and head circumference at birth (p = 4.1 \texttimes{} 10-13). The DNA methylation levels of IGF2, GNASAS, INSIGF and LEP were 48.5, 47.5, 79.4 and 25.7\% respectively. This was not significantly different between SGA and AGA individuals. Risk factors for being born SGA, including preeclampsia and maternal smoking, were also not associated with DNA methylation at these loci. Growth restriction early in development is not associated with DNA methylation at loci shown to be affected by prenatal famine exposure. Our and previous results by others indicate that prenatal growth restriction and famine exposure may be associated with different epigenetic changes or non-epigenetic mechanisms that may lead to similar later health outcomes.},

Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is associated with cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, communication problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, attention and executive function problems, language delay, lower intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, shorter anogenital distance in male infants, decreased relative numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in cord blood, wheeze, and asthma. Paternal preconception acetaminophen use for 8 day or more is associated with ADHD. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed significant association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and child asthma risk. Exposure for 29 day or more is probably danger. However, we cannot assert that exposure for 28 day or less is safe. At the present moment, any public organizations or academic associations have not declared the danger of acetaminophen in pregnancy. Each article has poor power to show risks of acetaminophen, however, the integration of the articles that showed adverse effects of acetaminophen may have power to show them. We should recognize that acetaminophen is danger in pregnancy. However, acetaminophen is the safest medicine as analgesics for nociceptive pain and antipyretics in childhood and pregnancy. Fever and pain during pregnancy themselves are probably associated with adverse gestational outcomes. Acetaminophen should be used at the lowest effective dosage and for the shortest time. We should use acetaminophen in pregnancy only when needed and no safer option for pain or fever relief is available. I would like public organizations or academic associations to declare danger (or safety) of acetaminophen in pregnancy.},

OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to assess the prenatal DDE exposure window and its effect on the psychomotor development index (PDI) and mental development index (MDI) during the first year of life. METHODS: We recruited 244 children whose pregnancies and deliveries were uncomplicated, and whose mothers were monitored throughout the pregnancy. Participating mothers were not occupationally exposed to DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) but were residents of a zone in Mexico with endemic malaria. We measured serum levels of DDE before pregnancy and during each trimester of the pregnancy. We evaluated PDI and MDI of the Bayley Scales for Infant Development (BSID-II), at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of age. We adjusted for quality of the home environment and maternal intellectual coefficient (IQ). We used generalized mixed-effects models for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Third-trimester DDE level (7.8 +/- 2.8 ppb) was significantly higher than the level at baseline, first, and second trimesters, but the differences never exceeded 20\%. Only DDE levels during the first trimester of pregnancy were associated with a significant reduction in PDI (every doubled increase of DDE level reduced the PDI 0.5 points). DDE was not associated with MDI. CONCLUSIONS: A critical window of exposure to DDE in utero may be the first trimester of the pregnancy, and psychomotor development is a target of this compound. Residues of DDT metabolites may present a risk of developmental delay for years after termination of DDT use.},

  abstract = {Background Recent studies have suggested an association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. However, these findings may be confounded by unmeasured factors related to maternal use of paracetamol and child outcomes. Objective To examine the association between duration and timing of prenatal paracetamol exposure on parent-reported communication skills, behaviour, and temperament in preschool-aged children, with focus on the role of unmeasured confounding. Methods We used data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Linear and generalised linear models with inverse probability weights and robust standard errors were used to quantify the association between prenatal paracetamol exposure and continuous and categorical outcomes. Results Of the 32 934 children included in our study, 8374 (25.4\%), 4961 (15.1\%), and 1791 (5.4\%) were prenatally exposed to paracetamol in one, two, and three trimesters, respectively. Children exposed to paracetamol in two trimesters scored lower on shyness compared with unexposed children ({$\beta$} -0.62, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -1.05, -0.19). Children exposed to paracetamol in three trimesters had a moderate increased risk of internalising behaviour problems (relative risk (RR) 1.36, 95\% CI 1.02, 1.80) and borderline externalising behaviour problems (RR 1.22, 95\% CI 0.93, 1.60) compared with unexposed children. Children exposed to paracetamol in 2nd/3rd trimester scored lower on shyness ({$\beta$} -0.32, 95\% CI -0.66, 0.02) compared with unexposed children. Sensitivity analyses indicated that unmeasured confounders play an important role and may potentially bias the effect estimates away from the null. Conclusions Timing of exposure and short-term use of paracetamol during pregnancy do not seem to pose any substantial risk of the outcomes examined. Although we found an association between paracetamol use in multiple trimesters and lower shyness and greater internalising behaviour in preschool-aged children, we cannot rule out chance or unmeasured confounding as possible explanations for these findings.},

METHOD: Maternal plasma and placental tissues from third-trimester pre-eclamptic women and gestational-age matched normotensive controls were studied. Real-time PCR was performed to quantify RASSF1A concentrations before and after methylation-sensitive restriction digestion in a duplex assay, where ss-actin concentrations were quantified as an internal control to confirm complete enzyme digestion. RESULTS: The median concentrations of hypermethylated RASSF1A were 4.3-fold higher in maternal plasma of pre-eclamptic subjects than in controls. There was no significant difference between the extent of RASSF1A hypermethylation in placental tissues obtained from pre-eclamptic and control pregnancies. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the potential utility of hypermethylated RASSF1A sequences in maternal plasma as a gender- and polymorphism-independent marker for pre-eclampsia.},

Over 100 imprinted genes have been identified in the mouse, the majority of which are both expressed and imprinted in the placenta.

Few imprinted genes have been assessed with respect to their dosage-related action in the placenta. Nonetheless, current data indicate that imprinted genes converge on two key functions of the placenta, nutrient transport and placental signalling.

  abstract = {The GNAS complex locus encodes the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs{$\alpha$}), a ubiquitous signaling protein mediating the actions of many hormones, neurotransmitters, and paracrine/aurocrine factors via generation of the second messenger cAMP. GNAS gives rise to other gene products, most of which exhibit exclusively monoallelic expression. In contrast, Gs{$\alpha$} is expressed biallelically in most tissues; however, paternal Gs{$\alpha$} expression is silenced in a small number of tissues through as-yet-poorly understood mechanisms that involve differential methylation within GNAS. Gs{$\alpha$}-coding GNAS mutations that lead to diminished Gs{$\alpha$} expression and/or function result in Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO) with or without hormone resistance, i.e. pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia/Ic and pseudo-pseudohypoparathryodism, respectively. Microdeletions that alter GNAS methylation and, thereby, diminish Gs{$\alpha$} expression in tissues in which the paternal Gs{$\alpha$} allele is normally silenced also cause hormone resistance, which occurs typically in the absence of AHO, a disorder termed pseudohypoparathyroidism typeIb. Mutations of GNAS that cause constitutive Gs{$\alpha$} signaling are found in patients with McCuneAlbright syndrome, fibrous dysplasia of bone, and different endocrine and non-endocrine tumors. Clinical features of these diseases depend significantly on the parental allelic origin of the GNAS mutation, reflecting the tissue-specific paternal Gs{$\alpha$} silencing. In this article, we review the pathogenesis and the phenotypes of these human diseases.},

  abstract = {Background: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides bioaccumulate through the food chain and cross the placenta. POPs are developmental toxicants in animals but the epidemiological evidence on pregnancy outcomes is inconsistent. Maternal gestational weight gain has been recently suggested as a key factor explaining the association between PCBs with lower birth weight. Aims: We examined whether in utero exposure to current low levels of different POPs is associated with fetal growth and gestational age in a mother\textendash child cohort in Crete, Greece (Rhea study), and evaluated specifically whether maternal gestational weight gain may affect this association. Methods: We included 1117 mothers and their newborns from the Rhea study. Mothers were interviewed and blood samples collected during the first trimester of pregnancy. Information on birth outcomes was retrieved from medical records. Concentrations of several PCBs, other organochlorine compounds (dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene [DDE], dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane [DDT] and hexachlorobenzene [HCB]) and one polybrominated diphenyl ether congener (tetra-bromodiphenyl ether [BDE-47]), were determined in maternal serum by triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of birth weight, gestational age, and head circumference with each compound individually on the log10 scale, and with combined exposures through the development of an exposure score. Results: In multivariate models, birth weight was negatively associated with increasing levels of HCB ({$\beta$} = - 161.1 g; 95\% CI: - 296.6, - 25.7) and PCBs ({$\beta$} = -174.1 g; 95\% CI: - 332.4, - 15.9); after further adjustment for gestational weight gain these estimates were slightly reduced ({$\beta$} = -154.3 g; 95\% CI: -300.8, -7.9 for HCB and {$\beta$} = -135.7 g; 95\% CI: -315.4, 43.9 for PCBs). Furthermore, in stratified analysis, the association between POPs and birth weight was only observed in women with inadequate or excessive gestational weight gain. Small, negative associations were observed with head circumference while no association was observed with gestational age. Conclusions: The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to PCBs and HCB impairs fetal growth and adds to the growing literature that demonstrates an association between low-level environmental pollutant exposure and fetal growth. Furthermore our results suggest that the association of POPs, maternal gestational weight gain and birth weight is probably more complex than that previously hypothesized.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the exposure of human embryos and foetuses to endocrine disrupting UV filters and PBs. Placentas from volunteer mothers in Barcelona were collected at delivery after informed, written consent by the pregnant women. UV filters and parabens were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The excellent performance of the method allowed measuring the target compounds in human placental tissue at low ng/g fresh weight level. The detection frequency of the selected compounds was in the range 17-100\%. Benzophenone-1, methyl paraben, butyl paraben and benzyl paraben were detected in all samples. The highest measured concentration corresponded to methyl paraben, 11.77ng/g fresh weight. Reported concentrations of benzophenone-4 and benzyl paraben constitute the first evidence about their accumulation in placenta. The results obtained corroborate that foetuses are exposed to a wide diversity of UV filters and PBs via the placenta.},

We evaluated in Spanish pregnant women (n=391) the reproducibility of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and predictors of exposure. We measured mono-(4-methyl-7-hydroxyoctyl) phthalate (7-OHMMeOP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2-carboxyhexyl) phthalate (MCMHP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) in two spot urine samples collected in the first and third pregnancy trimesters. Questionnaires on predictors and food-frequency questionnaires were administered in the first and/or third pregnancy trimesters. Using creatinine-adjusted phthalate metabolite concentrations (log10-trasformed) we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Linear mixed and regression models assessed the associations between predictors and phthalate metabolites. The ICCs ranged from 0.24 to 0.07 and were higher for MBzP, MEP, MiBP, and lower for MEOHP and MEHHP. Overweight, lower education and social class, and less frequent consumption of organic food were associated with higher levels of some phthalate metabolites. The use of household cleaning products (bleach, ammonia, glass cleaners, oven cleaning sprays and degreasing products) at least once per week during pregnancy was associated with 10-44\% higher urinary phthalate metabolites. Bottled-water consumption, consumption of food groups usually stored in plastic containers or cans, use of plastic containers for heating food and cosmetic use were not associated with increased concentrations of phthalate metabolites. This large study with repeated phthalate measurements suggests that, in this Spanish setting, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and household cleaning product use are better predictors of phthalate exposure levels in pregnant women than average water and food consumption and use of plastic containers and cosmetics.},

  abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides has been associated with altered neuronal cell development and behavioral changes in animal offspring. However, the few studies investigating the association between prenatal OP pesticide exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes such as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and autistic traits in children produced mixed findings. Objective: The objective of the present study was to examine whether maternal urinary concentrations of OP pesticide metabolites are associated with ADHD and autistic traits in children participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Method: Maternal concentrations of 6 dialkylphosphates (DAPs) were measured using gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in urine samples collected at {$<$} 18 weeks, 18-25 weeks, and {$>$} 25 weeks of gestation in 784 mother-child pairs. DAP metabolite concentrations were expressed as molar concentrations divided by creatinine levels and log10 transformed. ADHD traits were measured at ages 3, 6, and 10 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (n = 781) and autistic traits were measured at age 6 years using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (n = 622). First, regression models were fit for the averaged prenatal exposure across pregnancy. Second, we investigated associations for each collection phase separately, and applied a mutually adjusted model in which the effect of prenatal DAP concentrations from each time period on ADHD and autistic traits were jointly estimated. All associations were adjusted for relevant confounders. Results: Median DAP metabolite concentration was 309 nmol/g creatinine at {$<$} 18 weeks, 316 nmol/g creatinine at 18\textendash 25 weeks, and 308 nmol/g creatinine at {$>$} 25 weeks of gestation. Overall, DAP metabolite concentrations were not associated with ADHD traits. For instance, a log10 increase in averaged total DAP concentrations across gestation was not associated with a lower ADHD score (-0.03 per SD 95 CI: -0.28 to 0.23). Similarly, no associations between maternal DAP concentrations and autistic traits were detected. Conclusions: In this study of maternal urinary DAP metabolite concentrations during pregnancy, we did not observe associations with ADHD and autistic traits in children. These are important null observations because of the relatively high background DAP concentrations across pregnancy, the relatively large sample size, and the 10-year follow-up of the offspring. Given the measurement error inherent in our OP pesticide exposure},

However, when using data originating from multiple sources, a thorough and centralized quality control is essential. To facilitate this, we developed the QCEWAS R package. QCEWAS enables automated quality control of results files of EWAS. QCEWAS produces cohort-specific statistics and graphs to interpret the quality of the results files, graphs comparing results of multiple cohorts, as well as cleaned input files ready for meta-analysis.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms and DNA methylation in children. We report the first epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, based on peripheral blood DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450K array) in three population-based adult cohorts. METHODS: An epigenome-wide association study was performed in the Netherlands Twin Register (N = 2258, mean age 37 years), Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study (N = 800, age 38 years), and Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study (N = 1631, age 18 years), and results were combined through meta-analysis (total sample size N = 4689). Region-based analyses accounting for the correlation between nearby methylation sites were also performed. RESULTS: One epigenome-wide significant differentially methylated position was detected in the Dunedin study, but meta-analysis did not detect differentially methylated positions that were robustly associated across cohorts. In region-based analyses, six significant differentially methylation regions (DMRs) were identified in the Netherlands Twin Register, 19 in the Dunedin study, and none in the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study. Of these DMRs, 92\% were associated with methylation quantitative trait loci, and 68\% showed moderate to large bloodbrain correlations for DNA methylation levels. DMRs included six nonoverlapping DMRs (three in the Netherlands Twin Register, three in the Dunedin study) in the major histocompatibility complex, which were associated with expression of genes in the major histocompatibility complex, including C4A and C4B, previously implicated in schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point at new candidate loci involved in immune and neuronal functions that await further replication. Our work also illustrates the need for further research to examine to what extent epigenetic associations with psychiatric traits depend on characteristics such as age, comorbidities, exposures, and genetic background.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between prenatal exposure to BPA and birth and gestational outcomes. Design, Setting, Participants, and Outcome: Levels of unconjugated (uBPA) and BPA glucuronide in 80 matching samples of pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy and at delivery and matching term cord blood obtained from a prospective study conducted at the University of Michigan Hospitals were determined using a methodology validated in the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences funded Round Robin study and related to pregnancy outcomes. Results: Highest levels of uBPA were found in maternal term samples followed by first trimester maternal (M1) samples and cord blood. A 2-fold increase in M1 uBPA was associated with 55-g less birth weight when male and female pregnancies were combined and 183-g less birth weight with only female pregnancies. A 2-fold increase in maternal term uBPA was associated with an increased gestational length of 0.7 days for all pregnancies and 1.1 days for only female pregnancies. Conclusion: Higher uBPA exposure levels during first trimester and term are associated with sex-specific reduction in birth weight and increase in gestational length, respectively. Race, parity, and employment have an effect on BPA exposure. Because low birth weight is associated with adverse health outcomes, effect of early pregnancy BPA levels on reducing birth weight highlights the risk posed by developmental exposure to BPA.},

  abstract = {Benzophenones (BPs) are a family of compounds widely used to protect the skin and hair from UV irradiation. Despite human exposure to BPs through dermal application of products containing sunscreen agents and the increasing evidence that BPs are able to interfere with endocrine systems, few studies have examined the occurrence of BPs in humans. In this work, we propose a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to determine six BPs, namely, benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-2 (BP-2), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-6 (BP-6), benzophenone-8 (BP-8) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP) in human placental tissue samples. The method involves an extraction step of the analytes from the samples using ethyl acetate, followed by a clean-up step using centrifugation prior to their quantification by LC-MS/MS using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface in the positive mode. Benzophenone-d(10) (BP-d(10)) was used as surrogate. Found detection limits (LOD) ranged from 0.07 to 0.3 ng g(-1) and quantification limits (LOQ) from 0.3 to 1.0 ng g(-1), while inter- and intra-day variability was under 5\%. The method was validated using standard addition calibration and a recovery assay. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 98 to 104\%. This method was satisfactorily applied for the determination of BPs in 16 placental tissue samples collected from women who live in Granada (Spain).},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the industrial development has resulted in the appearance of a large amount of new chemicals that are able to produce disorders in the human endocrine system. These substances, so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), include many families of compounds, such as parabens and benzophenone-UV filters. Taking into account the demonstrated biological activity of these compounds, it is necessary to develop new analytical procedures to assess the exposure in order to establish, in an accurate way, relationships between EDCs and harmful health effects in population. In the present work, a new method based on a simplified sample treatment by matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) followed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC\textendash MS/MS) analysis, is validated for the determination of four parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl- and butylparaben) and six benzophenone-UV filters (benzophenone-1, benzophenone-2, benzophenone-3, benzophenone-6, benzophenone-8 and 4-hydroxybenzophenone) in human placental tissue samples. The extraction parameters were accurately optimized using multivariate optimization strategies. Ethylparaben ring-13C6 and benzophenone-d10 were used as surrogates. The found limits of quantification ranged from 0.2 to 0.4ngg-1 and inter-day variability (evaluated as relative standard deviation) ranged from 5.4\% to 12.8\%.

Gestational weight gain, which is associated negatively with PCB levels in maternal and cord blood, and positively with birth weight, could substantially confound this association.Objective: We sought to estimate the influence of gestational weight gain on the association between PCB-153 exposure and birth weight using a pharmacokinetic model.Methods: We modified a recently published pharmacokinetic model and ran Monte Carlo simulations accounting for variability in physiologic parameters and their correlations. We evaluated the pharmacokinetic model by comparing simulated plasma PCB-153 levels during pregnancy to serial measurements in 10 pregnant women from another study population. We estimated the association between simulated plasma PCB-153 levels and birth weight using linear regression models.Results: The plasma PCB-153 level profiles generated with the pharmacokinetic model were comparable to measured levels in 10 pregnant women. We estimated a 118-g decrease in birth weight (95\% CI: \textendash 129, \textendash 106 g) for each 1-{$\mu$}g/L increase in simulated cord plasma PCB-153, compared with the 150-g decrease estimated based on the previous meta-analysis.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate DNA methylation and expression of imprinted genes and an imprinted gene network (IGN) in neonates conceived via assisted reproductive technology (ART). DESIGN: Case control. SETTING: Research institution. PATIENT(S): Two hundred sixty-four cases of cord blood and/or placental villi from neonates (101 IVF, 81 ICSI, 82 naturally conceived). INTERVENTION(S): Placentas were obtained at birth for biopsy and cord blood extraction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): DNA methylation and expression of imprinted genes. RESULT(S): DNA methylation at the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region (DMR) was significantly higher in IVF cord blood (48.0\%) compared with controls (46.0\%). No differences were found in DNA methylation between conception modes for KvDMR1 and LINE-1 in cord blood and placenta as well as PLAGL1 and PEG10 in placenta villi. PLAGL1 expression was lower in both IVF and ICSI cord blood groups than in controls (relative quantification of 0.65, 0.74, 0.89, respectively). Analyzing the expression of 3 genes in a PLAGL1 regulated IGN revealed different expression between conception modes and a significant correlation to PLAGL1 expression in only one (KCNQ1OT1). CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a stability of DNA methylation at imprinted DMRs; however, we show PLAGL1 methylation/expression to be altered after ART. As PLAGL1 expression correlated with only one of the three IGN genes in cord blood, we propose there is a more complex mechanism of regulating the IGN that may involve other genes and epigenetic modifications in this tissue. Further research investigating IGN-implicated genes in various neonatal tissues is warranted to elucidate the full effects ART-induced alterations to PLAGL1 and the IGN may have on fetal growth/development.},

Maternal characteristics and physiological changes during gestation, such as gestational weight gain (GWG), may have an influence in the overall burden of POPs in neonates. However, the associations between GWG and POP concentrations are still not well established. Objective: We examined the association of GWG with cord serum POPs concentrations after adjusting for prepregnancy maternal body mass index (BMI) and other potential determinants of the transfer of POPs into newborns. The GWG values were evaluated after grouping by the reference guidelines of the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Methods: We measured levels of 14 organochlorine pesticides, 7 polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), and 14 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in 325 cord serum samples from a Spanish birth cohort. Multivariable models were used to estimate associations of GWG, prepregnancy BMI, and other maternal determinants on cord serum concentrations of POPs. Results: Neonatal concentrations of POPs were inversely associated with GWG after adjustment for age, prepregnancy BMI, educational level, and fish consumption. On average, neonates of women with IOM-recommended GWG have lower POP concentrations than do neonates of mothers with inadequate GWG. Conclusions: The present findings suggest an association between neonatal exposure to POPs and inadequate GWG during pregnancy. Encouraging pregnant women to meet the recommended IOM guidelines for GWG may reduce the accumulation of POPs in newborns.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous studies showed that children exposed to paracetamol during fetal life might have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental problems. Since paracetamol is one of the most commonly used medications during pregnancy, even small increases in the risk of neurodevelopmental problems may have considerable implications for public health.,  Methods: Using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, we applied propensity score (PS) matching to examine associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and neurodevelopmental problems among children at 18 months of age. Paracetamol use was classified into short-term ({$<$} 28 days) and long-term ({$\geq$} 28 days) of exposure.,  Results: Of the 51\,200 pregnancies included in our study, 40.5\% of mothers (n\,=\,20\,749) used paracetamol at least once during pregnancy. In the PS-matched analyses, long-term paracetamol exposure during pregnancy was associated with communication problems [odds ratio (OR): 1.38, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.98\textendash 1.95) and delayed motor milestone attainment (OR: 1.35, 95\% CI 1.07\textendash 1.70). We did not observe increased risks after short-term exposure. Sensitivity analyses for several indications showed similar effects as the PS-matched analyses, suggesting no confounding by indication.,  Conclusion: Long-term exposure to paracetamol in utero was associated with modestly increased risks of motor milestone delay and impaired communication skills among children at 18 months. Caution is warranted when considering long-term use of paracetamol during pregnancy; however, women with severe pain conditions should not be deprived of appropriate pharmacotherapy.},

  abstract = {Current risk assessment guidance calls for an individual chemical-by-chemical approach that fails to capture potential interactive effects of exposure to environmental mixtures and genetic variability. We conducted a review of the literature on relationships between prenatal and early life exposure to mixtures of lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and manganese (Mn) with neurodevelopmental outcomes. We then used an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework to integrate lines of evidence from multiple disciplines based on evolving guidance developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Toxicological evidence suggests a greater than additive effect of combined exposures to As-Pb-Cd and to Mn with any other metal, and several epidemiologic studies also suggest synergistic effects from binary combinations of Pb-As, Pb-Cd, and Pb-Mn. The exposure levels reported in these epidemiologic studies largely fall at the high-end (e.g., 95th percentile) of biomonitoring data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), suggesting a small but significant potential for high-end exposures. This review integrates multiple data sources using an AOP framework and provides an initial application of the OECD guidance in the context of potential neurodevelopmental toxicity of several metals, recognizing the evolving nature of regulatory interpretation and acceptance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parabens are a group of esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid utilized as antimicrobial preservatives in many personal care products. Epidemiological studies regarding the adverse effects of parabens on fetuses are limited. The aim of this study was to determine the association between placental paraben exposure and birth outcomes. We assessed paraben concentrations in placental tissue, which potentially gives a better understanding of fetal exposure than the maternal urinary concentrations which are the current golden standard. METHODS: Placental tissue was collected immediately after birth from 142 mother-child pairs from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. The placental concentrations of four parabens (methyl (MeP), ethyl (EtP), propyl (PrP), and butyl (BuP)) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass-spectrometry. Generalized linear regression models were used to determine the association between paraben exposure levels and birth outcomes. RESULTS: The geometric means of placental MeP, EtP, PrP, and BuP were 1.84, 2.16, 1.68 and 0.05\,ng/g tissue, respectively. The sum of parabens ({$\sum$} parabens, including MeP, EtP and PrP) was negatively associated with birth weight in newborn girls (-\,166\,g, 95\% CI: -\,322, -\,8.6, p\,=\,0.04) after adjustment for a priori selected covariates. The sum of parabens was negatively associated with head circumference (-\,0.6\,cm, 95\% CI: -\,1.1, -\,0.2, p\,=\,0.008) and borderline associated with birth length (-\,0.6\,cm, 95\% CI:-1.3, 0.1, p\,=\,0.08). In newborn girls the placental concentration of EtP was negatively associated with head circumference (-\,0.6\,cm, 95\% CI:-1.1, -\,0.1, p\,=\,0.01) and borderline significantly associated with birth weight and birth length. Lastly, placental EtP and {$\sum$}parabens were negatively associated with placental weight in newborn girls but not in newborn boys (-\,45.3\,g, 95\% CI:-86.2, -\,4.4, p\,=\,0.03). CONCLUSION: The negative association between maternal paraben exposure and birth outcomes warrants further research and follow-up over time to determine long term effects of gestational exposure to parabens.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Developmental periods in early life may be particularly vulnerable to impacts of environmental exposures. Human research on this topic has generally focused on single exposure-health effect relationships. The "exposome" concept encompasses the totality of exposures from conception onward, complementing the genome. OBJECTIVES: The Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) project is a new collaborative research project that aims to implement novel exposure assessment and biomarker methods to characterize early-life exposure to multiple environmental factors and associate these with omics biomarkers and child health outcomes, thus characterizing the "early-life exposome." Here we describe the general design of the project. METHODS: In six existing birth cohort studies in Europe, HELIX will estimate prenatal and postnatal exposure to a broad range of chemical and physical exposures. Exposure models will be developed for the full cohorts totaling 32,000 mother-child pairs, and biomarkers will be measured in a subset of 1,200 mother-child pairs. Nested repeat-sampling panel studies (n = 150) will collect data on biomarker variability, use smartphones to assess mobility and physical activity, and perform personal exposure monitoring. Omics techniques will determine molecular profiles (metabolome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome) associated with exposures. Statistical methods for multiple exposures will provide exposure-response estimates for fetal and child growth, obesity, neurodevelopment, and respiratory outcomes. A health impact assessment exercise will evaluate risks and benefits of combined exposures. CONCLUSIONS: HELIX is one of the first attempts to describe the early-life exposome of European populations and unravel its relation to omics markers and health in childhood. As proof of concept, it will form an important first step toward the life-course exposome.},

  abstract = {Introduction Copper is essential micronutrient and has an important role in the human body. The serum copper increases during pregnancy and is doubled at full term. Lower levels of serum copper in preg\- nancy are connected with some pathological conditions. Objective The aim of this study was to estimate the levels of serum copper in normal and pathological pregnancies, comparing them with values of serum copper in non-pregnant women, to determine if serum copper is lower in some pathological pregnancies and if this is of some importance. Methods A total of 2170 plasma samples for copper analyses were made in the following groups: healthy non-pregnant women; healthy pregnant women from the 5th-40th gestational week, during the first delivery stage and during the first three postpartum weeks, in pregnant women with habitual abortion, imminent abortion, abortion in progress, missed abortion (9th-24th weeks), missed labour and prema\- ture rupture of membranes (29th-40th weeks). Levels of serum copper were determined by colorimetric technique of bathocuproin with disulphate as a chromogen. Results Serum copper values in non-pregnant women range from 11.6-25.8 \textmu mol/L. In healthy preg\- nant women, there is a constant trend of the increase of serum copper. The mean serum copper val\- ues revealed three significant peaks at the 22nd, 27th and 35th gestational week. Serum copper values in the patients with some pathological pregnancies in relation to the serum copper values of the healthy pregnant women were significantly lower. Conclusion Serum copper values can be used as an indicator of some pathological pregnancies.},

  abstract = {Executive function is a critical behavioral trait rarely studied in relation to potential neurotoxicants. Prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) has been associated with adverse neurodevelopment, but there is limited research on executive function. Data from 256 mother-child pairs in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, a prospective birth cohort (2003-2006, Cincinnati, OH), was used to examine maternal serum PBDEs and PFASs and executive function in children ages 5 and 8 years. Maternal serum PBDEs and PFASs were measured at 16{$\pm$}3 weeks gestation. Executive function was assessed with the parent-rated Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), which yields composite measures: behavioral regulation index, metacognition index, and global executive composite. Higher BRIEF scores indicate executive function impairments. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations were used to estimate covariate-adjusted associations between PBDEs and PFASs and executive function. A 10-fold increase in BDE-153 was associated with poorer behavior regulation ({$\beta$}=3.23, 95\% CI 0.60, 5.86). Higher odds of having a score {$\geq$}60 in behavior regulation (OR=3.92, 95\% CI 1.76, 8.73) or global executive functioning (OR=2.34, 95\% CI 1.05, 5.23) was observed with increased BDE-153. Each ln-unit increase in perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was associated with poorer behavior regulation ({$\beta$}=3.14, 95\% CI 0.68, 5.61), metacognition ({$\beta$}=3.10, 95\% CI 0.62, 5.58), and global executive functioning ({$\beta$}=3.38, 95\% CI 0.86, 5.90). However, no association was observed between perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and executive function. Prenatal exposures to BDE-153 and PFOS may be associated with executive function deficits in school-age children.},

However, few epidemiological studies have examined the impact of childhood PFAS on neurodevelopment. Methods: We employed data from 208 children in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, a birth cohort (Cincinnati, OH), to examine associations of six serum PFAS concentrations measured at 3 and 8 years with executive function assessed at 8 years using the validated parent-completed Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function survey. We used multiple informant models to identify susceptible windows of neurotoxicity to PFAS and executive function. We investigated trajectories of PFAS concentrations and whether sex modified these associations. Results: Each ln-increase in perfluorononanoate (PFNA) at 8 years was associated with a 3.4-point increase (95\% CI 0.4, 6.3) in metacognition score, indicating poorer function. Children with PFNA above the median at 8 years had poorer global executive functioning compared to children with concentrations consistently below median levels ({$\beta$} = 6.5, 95\% CI 0.2, 12.9). Higher concurrent PFNA was associated with poorer behavior regulation among males, while associations among females were null (pPFNA\texttimes sex = 0.018). Children with higher concurrent perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) had increased odds of being at risk of having clinical impairments in metacognition (OR = 3.18, 95\% CI 1.17, 8.60). There were no associations between perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorohexane sulfonate and executive function. Conclusions: PFNA and PFOA at 8 years, but not 3 years, may be related to poorer executive function at 8 years. Results need to be confirmed in cohort studies with larger sample sizes.},

Methods: Using data from 218 mother-child dyads from the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, we examined prenatal and childhood (3 and 8 years) serum concentrations of four PFAS and inattention, impulsivity, and visual spatial abilities. At 8 years, we used the Conners' Continuous Performance Test-II to assess attention and impulse control and the Virtual Morris Water Maze (VMWM) to measure visual spatial abilities. Results: In multiple informant models, there was no evidence to indicate that prenatal or childhood PFAS are associated with attention. However, there was an inverse association between prenatal ln-perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and errors of commission ({$\beta$} = -2.0, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] -3.8, -0.3). Ln-perfluorononanoate (PFNA) at 3 years was associated with longer (poorer) VMWM completion times of 3.6 seconds (CI 1.6, 5.6). However, higher concurrent concentrations of ln-perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) ({$\beta$} = -2.4 s, 95\% CI -4.4, -0.3) were associated with shorter (better) times. Higher prenatal PFHxS was positively associated with percentage of traveling distance in the correct quadrant ({$\beta$} = 4.2\%, 95\% CI 0.8, 7.7), indicating better performance. Conclusion: Findings were mixed for prenatal and childhood PFAS concentrations and visual spatial abilities. There is not enough evidence to support that PFAS are associated with visual spatial abilities as assessed by the VMWM or CPT-II measures of inattention or impulsivity in children at age 8 years.},

  abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are recognized neurotoxicants, but the extent to which PBDEs influence various domains of behavior in children is not fully understood. As such, we reviewed epidemiologic studies published to date to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on PBDEs' potential role in behavioral development. We identified 19 epidemiologic studies reporting on associations of prenatal and childhood concentrations of PBDEs with behaviors assessed in children from 1 to 12 years, including executive function, attention, externalizing and internalizing behaviors, adaptive skills, and social behaviors/Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). While the mechanisms of PBDE neurotoxicity in humans are still not clearly elucidated, findings from this review indicate that PBDE exposure during fetal development is associated with impairments in executive function and poorer attentional control in children. Results from large prospective cohorts demonstrate that prenatal and postnatal PBDE exposure adversely impacts externalizing behavior (e.g., hyperactivity and conduct problems). Additional studies are needed to determine whether PBDEs are associated with internalizing problems, adaptive skills, and social behaviors/ASD in children. Future studies will help better understand the potential neurotoxic effects of PBDE exposures during adolescence, possible sex-dependent effects, and the impact of exposure to BDE-209 and alternative flame retardants. Future studies should also examine chemical mixtures to capture real-world exposures when examining PBDEs and their impact on various behavioral domains in the context of multiple chemical exposures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxicological studies indicate that poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may be neurotoxic, but human studies have yet to provide compelling evidence for PFAS' impact on cognitive abilities. OBJECTIVE: To test whether prenatal and childhood PFAS are associated with cognitive abilities at 8 years and whether sex modifies these associations. METHODS: We included 221 mother-child pairs from the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a birth cohort in Cincinnati, OH (USA). We quantified PFAS in maternal serum at 16 {$\pm$} 3 weeks gestation and in child serum at 3 and 8 years. We used the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) at age 8 years, assessing Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. We used multiple informant models to estimate covariate-adjusted differences in WISC-IV scores by repeated ln-transformed PFAS. RESULTS: Prenatal and childhood perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) were not associated with WISC-IV measures. We observed an increase of 4.1-points (95\% CI 0.3, 8.0) and 5.7-points (95\% CI 1.2, 10.2) in working memory with 1-ln unit increase in prenatal perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorononanoate (PFNA), respectively. In addition, PFNA at 3 years was associated with better FSIQ and perceptual reasoning. Child sex modified the relationship between prenatal PFOA and FSIQ; the association was positive in females only. Sex also modified the association between concurrent PFOS and FSIQ, with males having higher scores. CONCLUSION: We did not observe adverse associations between prenatal and childhood PFAS and cognitive function at age 8 years.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for normal development; therefore, disruption of TH action by a number of industrial chemicals is critical to identify. Several chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls are metabolized by the dioxin-inducible enzyme CYP1A1; some of their metabolites can interact with the TH receptor. In animals, this mechanism is reflected by a strong correlation between the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA and TH-regulated mRNAs. If this mechanism occurs in humans, we expect that CYP1A1 expression will be positively correlated with the expression of genes regulated by TH. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that CYP1A1 mRNA expression is correlated with TH-regulated mRNAs in human placenta. METHODS: One hundred sixty-four placental samples from pregnancies with no thyroid disease were obtained from the GESTE study (Sherbrooke, Qu\'ebec, Canada). Maternal and cord blood TH levels were measured at birth. The mRNA levels of CYP1A1 and placental TH receptor targets [placental lactogen (PL) and GH-V] were quantitated by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: CYP1A1 mRNA abundance varied 5-fold across 132 placental samples that had detectable CYP1A1 mRNA. CYP1A1 mRNA was positively correlated with PL (r = 0.64; P {$<$} .0001) and GH-V (P {$<$} .0001, r = 0.62) mRNA. PL and GH-V mRNA were correlated with each other (r = 0.95; P {$<$} .0001), suggesting a common activator. The mRNAs not regulated by TH were not correlated with CYP1A1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: CYP1A1 mRNA expression is strongly associated with the expression of TH-regulated target gene mRNAs in human placenta, consistent with the endocrine-disrupting action of metabolites produced by CYP1A1.},

Some studies suggest that epigenetic changes might be causal in the development of the psychiatric condition under investigation. However, other scenarios are possible, e.g., statistical confounding or reverse causation, making it particularly challenging to derive conclusions on causality. In the present review, we examine the evidence from human population studies for a possible role of epigenetic mechanisms in neurodevelopment and mental health and discuss methodological approaches on how to strengthen causal inference, including the need for replication, (quasi-)experimental approaches and Mendelian randomization.

  abstract = {One of the dominant effects of glucocorticoids in triggering parturition in certain animal species is to drive the placental conversion of progesterone to estrogen. However, in the human placenta, estrogen is formed using dehydroepiandrosterone from the fetal adrenal glands rather than progesterone as precursor. Although aromatization of dehydroepiandrosterone is crucial in estrogen synthesis in human placenta, it is not known whether glucocorticoids affect aromatase expression. Human term placental syncytiotrophoblasts were used to examine the effect of cortisol on aromatase expression. The signaling pathway and transcription factors involved were identified in this study. Results showed that cortisol induced aromatase expression in a concentration-dependent manner, which was mediated indirectly by glucocorticoid receptor and required the participation of other proteins. The induction of aromatase by cortisol could be blocked by either specificity protein 1 (Sp1) antagonist mithramycin or knockdown of Sp1 expression. The induction of aromatase and Sp1 by cortisol could be prevented by inhibitors of the cAMP pathway, whereas activators of the cAMP pathway induced Sp1 and aromatase expression as well as Sp1 binding to aromatase promoter. Concomitantly, cortisol treatment and activation of the cAMP pathway led to increased acetylation and decreased methylation of histone 3 at the aromatase promoter. In conclusion, cortisol stimulates aromatase expression through the cAMP/Sp1 pathway in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts. These findings reveal a novel role of cortisol in increasing the local level of estrogen within the placenta that would help transform the myometrium to a contractile state, thereby contributing to a cascade of events leading to human parturition.},

Epigenetic regulation encompasses three types of changes: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs, each of which has been shown to play a key role in controlling epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. As we gain deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms controlling EMT processes and orchestrating all the metastatic steps, we broaden the therapeutic potentials of epigenetic drugs, such as DNA demethylating drugs and histone deacetylase/demethylase inhibitors, which can act upon metastasis-related genes, restoring their expression and biological functions.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation plays an important role in disease etiology. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450K) BeadChip is a widely used platform in large-scale epidemiologic studies. This platform can efficiently and simultaneously measure methylation levels at {$\sim$}480,000 CpG sites in the human genome in multiple study samples. Due to the intrinsic chip design of 2 types of chemistry probes, data normalization or preprocessing is a critical step to consider before data analysis. To date, numerous methods and pipelines have been developed for this purpose, and some studies have been conducted to evaluate different methods. However, validation studies have often been limited to a small number of CpG sites to reduce the variability in technical replicates. In this study, we measured methylation on a set of samples using both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and 450K chips. We used WGBS data as a gold standard of true methylation states in cells to compare the performances of 8 normalization methods for 450K data on a genome-wide scale. Analyses on our dataset indicate that the most effective methods are peak-based correction (PBC) and quantile normalization plus {$\beta$}-mixture quantile normalization (QN.BMIQ). To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically compare existing normalization methods for Illumina 450K data using novel WGBS data. Our results provide a benchmark reference for the analysis of DNA methylation chip data, particularly in white blood cells.},

Here, we show that the level of urinary TCS in 28.3\% patients who had spontaneous abortion in mid-gestation were increased by 11.3-fold (high-TCS) compared with normal pregnancies. Oral administration of TCS (10\,mg/kg/day) in mice (TCS mice) caused an equivalent urinary TCS level as those in the high-TCS abortion patients. The TCS-exposure from gestation day (GD) 5.5 caused dose-dependently fetal death during GD12.5-16.5 with decline of live fetal weight. GD15.5 TCS mice appeared placental thrombus and tissue necrosis with enhancement of platelet aggregation. The levels of placenta and plasma estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) mRNA and protein in TCS mice or high-TCS abortion patients were not altered, but their EST activities were significantly reduced compared to controls. Although the levels of serum estrogen (E2) in TCS mice and high-TCS abortion patients had no difference from controls, their ratio of sulfo-conjugated E2 and unconjugated E2 was reduced. The estrogen receptor antagonist ICI-182,780 prevented the enhanced platelet aggregation and placental thrombosis and attenuated the fetal death in TCS mice. The findings indicate that TCS-exposure might cause spontaneous abortion probably through inhibition of EST activity to produce placental thrombosis.},

We consider maximum likelihood function plus a penalty including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), and minimax concave penalty (MCP). An EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is proposed for estimating the model parameters and conducting variable selection simultaneously. This algorithm consists of estimating penalized weighted negative binomial models and penalized logistic models via the coordinated descent algorithm. Furthermore, statistical properties including the standard error formulae are provided. A simulation study shows that the new algorithm not only has more accurate or at least comparable estimation, but also is more robust than the traditional stepwise variable selection.

  abstract = {Pediatric cardiac surgery may lead to poor outcomes such as acute kidney injury (AKI) and prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS). Plasma and urine biomarkers may help with early identification and prediction of these adverse clinical outcomes. In a recent multi-center study, 311 children undergoing cardiac surgery were enrolled to evaluate multiple biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of AKI and other clinical outcomes. LOS is often analyzed as count data, thus Poisson regression and negative binomial (NB) regression are common choices for developing predictive models. With many correlated prognostic factors and biomarkers, variable selection is an important step. The present paper proposes new variable selection methods for Poisson and NB regression. We evaluated regularized regression through penalized likelihood function. We first extend the elastic net (Enet) Poisson to two penalized Poisson regression: Mnet, a combination of minimax concave and ridge penalties; and Snet, a combination of smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and ridge penalties. Furthermore, we extend the above methods to the penalized NB regression. For the Enet, Mnet, and Snet penalties (EMSnet), we develop a unified algorithm to estimate the parameters and conduct variable selection simultaneously. Simulation studies show that the proposed methods have advantages with highly correlated predictors, against some of the competing methods. Applying the proposed methods to the aforementioned data, it is discovered that early postoperative urine biomarkers including NGAL, IL18, and KIM-1 independently predict LOS, after adjusting for risk and biomarker variables.},

Little is known about the potential impact of prenatal TCS exposure on fetal reproductive development as well as its potential mechanism. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the potential effect of prenatal TCS exposure on fetal reproductive hormones in cord blood and its potential mechanism in relation to placental steroidogenic enzymes. METHODS: Urinary TCS was detected among 537 healthy pregnant women from a prospective cohort in China. Four reproductive hormones in cord blood, namely E2 (n=430), T (n=424), LH (n=428) and FSH (n=373), and three steroidogenic enzymes in placenta, namely P450arom (n=233), 3{$\beta$}-HSD (n=227) and 17{$\beta$}-HSD (n=222), were measured. RESULTS: Prenatal TCS exposure was associated with increased testosterone concentrations in cord blood in a dose-dependent manner. Infants with prenatal TCS levels {$>$}0.6{$\mu$}g/L had, on average, a 0.23ng/mL (95\% CI: 0.05, 0.45, p=0.02) higher testosterone concentrations in cord blood compared to those with prenatal TCS levels {$<$}0.1{$\mu$}g/L. Of note, prenatal TCS exposure was associated with increased testosterone and decreased E2 concentrations in cord blood among male infants. Adverse associations were found between the prenatal TCS exposure and concentrations of three placental steroidogenic enzymes. 3{$\beta$}-HSD and P450arom demonstrated mediating effects in the association between prenatal TCS exposure and testosterone concentrations in cord blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested potential impacts of prenatal TCS exposure on reproductive hormones in cord blood mediated by steroidogenic enzymes, and male infants were more vulnerable.},

Accumulating evidence has documented that various environmental exposure scenarios may cause maternal and fetal epigenetic changes, which initiates the focus on whether epigenetics can contribute to the occurrence of sPTB. Therefore, we conducted the current study to examine and compare the DNA methylation changes associated with sPTB in placenta and cord blood. Methods: This hospital-based case-control study was carried out at three Women and Children's hospitals in South China, where 32 spontaneous preterm births and 16 term births were recruited. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of the placenta and cord blood from these subjects were measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip, and sPTB-associated differential methylated CpG sites were identified using limma regression model, after controlling for major maternal and infant confounders. Further Gene Ontology analysis was performed with PANTHER in order to assess different functional enrichment of the sPTB-associated genes in placenta and cord blood. Results: After controlling for potential confounding factors, one differentially methylated position (DMP) in placenta and 31 DMPs in cord blood were found significantly associated with sPTB (Bonferroni corrected p {$<$} 0.05). The sPTBassociated CpG sites in placenta were mapped to genes that showed higher enrichment on biological processes including biological regulation, multicellular organismal process, and especially response to stimulus, while those in cord blood were mapped to genes that had higher enrichment on biological processes concerning cellular process, localization, and particularly metabolic process. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicated that DNA methylation alteration in both placenta and cord blood are associated with sPTB, yet the DNA methylation modification patterns may appear differently in placenta and cord blood.},

  abstract = {Phthalates (diesters of phthalic acid) are widely used as plasticizers and additives in many consumer products. Laboratory animal studies have reported the endocrine-disrupting and reproductive effects of phthalates, and human exposure to this class of chemicals is a concern. Several phthalates have been recognized as substances of high concern. Human exposure to phthalates occurs mainly via dietary sources, dermal absorption, and air inhalation. Phthalates are excreted as conjugated monoesters in urine, and some phthalates, such as di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), undergo secondary metabolism, including oxidative transformation, prior to urinary excretion. The occurrence of phthalates and their metabolites in urine, serum, breast milk, and semen has been widely reported. Urine has been the preferred matrix in human biomonitoring studies, and concentrations on the order of several tens to hundreds of nanograms per milliliter have been reported for several phthalate metabolites. Metabolites of diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl- (DBP) and diisobutyl- (DiBP) phthalates, and DEHP were the most abundant compounds measured in urine. Temporal trends in phthalate exposures varied among countries. In the United States (US), DEHP exposure has declined since 2005, whereas DiNP exposure has increased. In China, DEHP exposure has increased since 2000. For many phthalates, exposures in children are higher than those in adults. Human epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between phthalate exposures and adverse reproductive outcomes in women and men, type II diabetes and insulin resistance, overweight/obesity, allergy, and asthma. This review compiles biomonitoring studies of phthalates and exposure doses to assess health risks from phthalate exposures in populations across the globe.},

The general framework is to minimize a loss function subject to a penalty designed to generate sparse variable selection. Much of the previous work have focused on convex loss functions including generalized linear models. When data are contaminated with noise, robust loss functions are typically introduced. Recent literature has witnessed a growing impact of nonconvex loss-based methods, which can generate robust estimation for data contaminated with outliers. This article investigates robust variable selection based on penalized nonconvex loss functions. We investigate properties of the local and global minimizers of the original penalized loss function and the surrogate penalized loss function induced by the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm for numerical computation. We establish convergence theory of the proposed MM algorithm for penalized convex and nonconvex loss functions. Performance of the proposed algorithms for regression and classification problems are evaluated on simulated and real data including healthcare costs and cancer clinical status. Efficient implementations of the algorithms are available in the R package mpath in CRAN.},

The number of reports regarding to the profiling of m6A modification and its potential role in the placenta of preeclampsia (PE) is small. In this work, placental samples were collected from PE and control patients. Expression of m6A-related genes was investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq were performed to detect m6A methylation and mRNA expression profiles. Gene ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were also conducted to explore the modified genes and their clinical significance. Our findings show that METTL3 and METTL14 were up-regulated in PE. In total, 685 m6A peaks were differentially expressed as determined by MeRIP-seq. Altered peaks of m6A-modified transcripts were primarily associated with nitrogen compound metabolic process, positive regulation of vascular-associated smooth muscle cell migration, and endoplasmic reticulum organisation. The m6A hyper-methylated genes of Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signalling pathway, mTOR signalling pathway, and several cancer-related pathways may contribute to PE. We also verified that the significant increase of HSPA1A mRNA and protein expression was regulated by m6A modification, suggesting m6A plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression. Our data provide novel information regarding m6A modification alterations in PE and help our understanding of the pathogenesis of PE.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Growing evidence exists about the fetal and environmental origins of hypertension, but mainly limited to single-exposure studies. The exposome has been proposed as a more holistic approach by studying many exposures simultaneously. OBJECTIVES This study aims to evaluate the association between a wide range of prenatal and postnatal exposures and blood pressure (BP) in children. METHODS Systolic and diastolic BP were measured among 1,277 children from the European HELIX (Human Early-Life Exposome) cohort aged 6 to 11 years. Prenatal (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 89) and postnatal (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 128) exposures include air pollution, built environment, meteorology, natural spaces, traffic, noise, chemicals, and lifestyles. Two methods adjusted for confounders were applied: an exposome-wide association study considering the exposures independently, and the deletionsubstitution-addition algorithm considering all the exposures simultaneously. RESULTS Decreases in systolic BP were observed with facility density (b change for an interquartile-range increase in exposure: \`A1.7 mm Hg [95\% confidence interval (CI): \`A2.5 to \`A0.8 mm Hg]), maternal concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyl 118 (\`A1.4 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.6 to \`A0.2 mm Hg]) and child concentrations of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE: \`A1.6 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.4 to \`A0.7 mm Hg]), hexachlorobenzene (\`A1.5 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.4 to \`A0.6 mm Hg]), and mono\`Abenzyl phthalate (\`A0.7 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A1.3 to \`A0.1 mm Hg]), whereas increases in systolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature during pregnancy (1.6 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.2 to 2.9 mm Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (2.0 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.4 to 3.5 mm Hg]), maternal cotinine concentrations (1.2 mm Hg [95\% CI: -0.3 to 2.8 mm Hg]), and child perfluorooctanoate concentrations (0.9 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.1 to 1.6 mm Hg]). Decreases in diastolic BP were observed with outdoor temperature at examination (\`A1.4 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A2.3 to \`A0.5 mm Hg]) and child DDE concentrations (\`A1.1 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A1.9 to \`A0.3 mm Hg]), whereas increases in diastolic BP were observed with maternal bisphenol-A concentrations (0.7 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.1 to 1.4 mm Hg]), high fish intake during pregnancy (1.2 mm Hg [95\% CI: \`A0.2 to 2.7 mm Hg]), and child copper concentrations (0.9 mm Hg [95\% CI: 0.3 to 1.6 mm Hg]). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that early-life exposure to several chemicals, as well as built environment and meteorological factors, may affect BP in children.

  abstract = {Throughout most of the mammalian genome, genetically regulated developmental programming establishes diverse yet predictable epigenetic states across differentiated cells and tissues. At metastable epialleles (MEs), conversely, epigenotype is established stochastically in the early embryo then maintained in differentiated lineages, resulting in dramatic and systemic interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation. In the mouse, maternal nutrition affects this process, with permanent phenotypic consequences for the offspring. MEs have not previously been identified in humans. Here, using an innovative 2-tissue parallel epigenomic screen, we identified putative MEs in the human genome. In autopsy samples, we showed that DNA methylation at these loci is highly correlated across tissues representing all 3 embryonic germ layer lineages. Monozygotic twin pairs exhibited substantial discordance in DNA methylation at these loci, suggesting that their epigenetic state is established stochastically. We then tested for persistent epigenetic effects of periconceptional nutrition in rural Gambians, who experience dramatic seasonal fluctuations in nutritional status. DNA methylation at MEs was elevated in individuals conceived during the nutritionally challenged rainy season, providing the first evidence of a permanent, systemic effect of periconceptional environment on human epigenotype. At MEs, epigenetic regulation in internal organs and tissues varies among individuals and can be deduced from peripheral blood DNA. MEs should therefore facilitate an improved understanding of the role of interindividual epigenetic variation in human disease.},

Animal and in vitro studies suggest that exposure to these compounds may be related to a number of adverse health outcomes, as well as potential mediators such as oxidative stress and inflammation. We examined urinary phenol (bisphenol A (BPA), triclosan (TCS), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 2,4-dichlorophenol (24-DCP), 2,5-dichlorophenol (25-DCP)) and paraben (butyl paraben (B-PB), methyl paraben (M-PB), propyl paraben (P-PB)) concentrations measured three times during pregnancy in relation to markers of oxidative stress and inflammation among participants in the Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) project. Serum markers of inflammation (c-reactive protein (CRP), IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$})) were measured twice during pregnancy (n=105 subjects, 187 measurements) and urinary markers of oxidative stress (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (OHdG) and isoprostane) were measured three times during pregnancy (n=54 subjects, 146 measurements). We used linear mixed models to assess relationships between natural log-transformed exposure and outcome biomarkers while accounting for within individual correlation across study visits. After adjustment for urinary specific gravity, study visit, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and maternal education, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in urinary BPA was associated with 21\% higher OHdG (p=0.001) and 29\% higher isoprostane (p=0.0002), indicating increased oxidative stress. The adjusted increase in isoprostane per IQR increase in marker of exposure was 17\% for BP-3, 27\% for B-PB, and 20\% for P-PB (all p{$<$}0.05). An IQR increase in triclosan (TCS) was associated with 31\% higher serum concentrations of IL-6 (p=0.007), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. In contrast, IQR increases in BP-3 and B-PB were significantly associated with 16\% and 18\% lower CRP, a measure of systemic inflammation. Our findings suggest that exposure to BPA, select parabens, and TCS during pregnancy may be related to oxidative stress and inflammation, potential mechanisms by which exposure to these compounds may influence birth outcomes and other adverse health effects, but additional research is needed.},

Here, a well-designed information repository, MetaImprint (http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/MetaImprint), is presented, which focuses on the collection of information concerning mammalian imprinted genes. The current version of MetaImprint incorporates 539 imprinted genes, including 255 experimentally confirmed genes, and their detailed research courses from eight mammalian species. MetaImprint also hosts genome-wide genetic and epigenetic information of imprinted genes, including imprinting control regions, single nucleotide polymorphisms, non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation and histone modifications. Information related to human diseases and functional annotation was also integrated into MetaImprint. To facilitate data extraction, MetaImprint supports multiple search options, such as by gene ID and disease name. Moreover, a configurable Imprinted Gene Browser was developed to visualize the information on imprinted genes in a genomic context. In addition, an Epigenetic Changes Analysis Tool is provided for online analysis of DNA methylation and histone modification differences of imprinted genes among multiple tissues and cell types. MetaImprint provides a comprehensive information repository of imprinted genes, allowing researchers to investigate systematically the genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of imprinted genes and their functions in development and diseases.},

Applying ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, TCS and TCC concentrations were measured in maternal and fetal sera. Significantly increased levels of TCS were detected in maternal sera from mothers with abnormal births. Similar levels of TCS or TCC were found in maternal and cord sera in control group. The concentrations of TCS or TCC in maternal sera correlated with those in umbilical cord sera (r=0.649, P{$<$}0.01).

Imprinted genes are known to regulate fetal growth and a `kinship' or `parental conflict' model predicts that paternally- and maternally-expressed imprinted genes promote and inhibit fetal growth, respectively. In this review we examine the role of imprinted genes in postnatal growth and metabolism, with an emphasis on the GNAS/Gnas locus. GNAS is a complex imprinted locus with multiple oppositely imprinted gene products, including the G protein {$\alpha$}-subunit Gs{$\alpha$} which is expressed primarily from the maternal allele in some tissues and the Gs{$\alpha$} isoform XL{$\alpha$}s which is expressed only from the paternal allele. Maternal, but not paternal, Gs{$\alpha$} mutations lead to obesity in Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. Mouse studies show that this phenomenon is due to Gs{$\alpha$} imprinting in the central nervous system leading to a specific defect in the ability of central melanocortins to stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity and energy expenditure. In contrast mutation of paternally-expressed XL{$\alpha$}s leads to opposite metabolic effects in mice. While these findings conform to the `kinship' model, the effects of other imprinted genes on body weight regulation do not conform to this model.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Triclosan (TCS) is an antibacterial agent commonly added to personal care products. Some animal research studies have associated TCS exposure with androgenic and thyroid effects, as well as endocrine disruption, contact dermatitis and skin irritation. Limited Canadian data exist on exposure levels, temporal variability and sources of exposure to TCS, especially among pregnant women. METHODS: Single and serial spot urine samples (n=1249), as well as consumer product use information were collected over 5 study visits across pregnancy and post-partum from 80 healthy pregnant women in Ottawa, Canada. Urine samples were analyzed for TCS by GC-MS-MS. Summary statistics, linear mixed effects models, and surrogate category analysis were used to describe the results. RESULTS: Triclosan was detected in 87\% of maternal urine samples (LOD=3.0{$\mu$}g/L). The geometric mean TCS concentration of all urine samples was 21.6{$\mu$}g/L (95\% CI 18.2-25.7). Triclosan concentrations were significantly higher when the urine was collected before 16:00, in the autumn, and more than 90min since last void, and in nulliparous women with household incomes greater than \$100,000. A significant correlation was observed between maternal urinary TCS concentrations and number of reported uses of TCS-containing products. The ability of a single spot urine sample collected at any time during or post-pregnancy to predict an individual's geometric mean urinary TCS level corresponding to low, medium, or high exposure was 86.7\%. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated high reproducibility within a week-day (0.77) and week-end day (0.79) and moderate reproducibility across the study period (0.50). CONCLUSIONS: This study provided the first data on temporal variability of urinary TCS concentrations and predictors of exposure in Canadian pregnant women. These results can inform exposure assessments in pregnant women and justify collection of single spot urine samples in epidemiologic studies, especially for women with higher exposures.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research suggests that prenatal phthalate exposures affect child executive function and behavior. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated associations between phthalate metabolite concentrations in maternal prenatal urine and mental, motor, and behavioral development in children at 3 years of age. METHODS: Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and four di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites were measured in a spot urine sample collected from 319 women during the third trimester. When children were 3 years of age, the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) were measured using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, and behavior problems were assessed by maternal report on the Child Behavior Checklist. RESULTS: Child PDI scores decreased with increasing loge MnBP [estimated adjusted {$\beta$}-coefficient = -2.81; 95\% confidence interval (CI): -4.63, -1.0] and loge MiBP ({$\beta$} = -2.28; 95\% CI: -3.90, -0.67); odds of motor delay increased significantly [per loge MnBP: estimated adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.64; 95\% CI: 1.10, 2.44; per loge MiBP: adjusted OR =1.82; 95\% CI: 1.24, 2.66]. In girls, MDI scores decreased with increasing loge MnBP ({$\beta$} = -2.67; 95\% CI: -4.70, -0.65); the child sex difference in odds of mental delay was significant (p = 0.037). The ORs for clinically withdrawn behavior were 2.23 (95\% CI: 1.27, 3.92) and 1.57 (95\% CI: 1.07, 2.31) per loge unit increase in MnBP and MBzP, respectively; for clinically internalizing behaviors, the OR was 1.43 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.90) per loge unit increase in MBzP. Significant child sex differences were seen in associations between MnBP and MBzP and behaviors in internalizing domains (p {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: Certain prenatal phthalate exposures may decrease child mental and motor development and increase internalizing behaviors.},

  abstract = {Despite recent evidence that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) possesses roles in gene regulation distinct from 5-methylcytosine (5mC), relatively little is known regarding the functions of 5hmC in mammalian tissues. To address this issue, we utilized an approach combining both paired bisulfite (BS) and oxidative bisulfite (oxBS) DNA treatment, to resolve genome-wide patterns of 5hmC and 5mC in normal breast tissue from disease-free women. Although less abundant than 5mC, 5hmC was differentially distributed, and consistently enriched among breast-specific enhancers and transcriptionally active chromatin. In contrast, regulatory regions associated with transcriptional inactivity, such as heterochromatin and repressed Polycomb regions, were relatively depleted of 5hmC. Gene regions containing abundant 5hmC were significantly associated with lactate oxidation, immune cell function, and prolactin signaling pathways. Furthermore, genes containing abundant 5hmC were enriched among those actively transcribed in normal breast tissue. Finally, in independent data sets, normal breast tissue 5hmC was significantly enriched among CpG loci demonstrated to have altered methylation in pre-invasive breast cancer and invasive breast tumors. Primarily, our findings identify genomic loci containing abundant 5hmC in breast tissues and provide a genome-wide map of nucleotide-level 5hmC in normal breast tissue. Additionally, these data suggest 5hmC may participate in gene regulatory programs that are dysregulated during breast-related carcinogenesis.},

We predict that levels of placental-derived proteins circulating in maternal blood reflect placental gene expression, which is associated with placental DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. As such, placental DNAm profiling may be useful to distinguish pregnancies at risk of developing complications and correlation between DNAm and protein levels in maternal blood may give further evidence for a protein's use as a biomarker. However, few studies investigate all clinical parameters that may influence DNAm and/or protein expression, which can significantly affect the relationship between these measures.},

  abstract = {Placental health is a key component to a successful pregnancy. Placental insufficiency (PI), inadequate nutrient delivery to the fetus, is associated with preeclampsia (PE), a maternal hypertensive disorder, and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), pathologically poor fetal growth. PI is more common in early-onset PE (EOPE) than late-onset PE (LOPE). However, the relationship between these disorders remains unclear. While DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations have been identified in PE and IUGR, these entities can overlap and few studies have analysed them separately. This study aims to utilize DNAm profiling to better understand the underlying placental variation associated with PE and IUGR. Placental samples from a discovery (43 controls, 22 EOPE, 18 LOPE, 11 IUGR) and validation cohort (15 controls, 22 EOPE, 11 LOPE) were evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. To account for gestational age (GA) effects, EOPE samples were compared with pre-term births of varying etiologies (GA\,{$<$}37 weeks). LOPE and IUGR were compared with term controls (GA\,{$>$}37 weeks). While 1703 sites were differentially methylated (DM) (FDR\,{$<$}\,0.05, {$\Delta\beta$}\,{$>$}\,0.1) in EOPE, few changes were associated with LOPE (N\,=\,5), or IUGR (N\,=\,0). Of the 1703 EOPE sites, 599 validated in the second cohort. Using these 599 sites, both cohorts clustered into three distinct groups. Interestingly, LOPE samples diagnosed between 34 and 36 weeks with co-occurring IUGR clustered with the EOPE. DNAm profiling may provide an independent tool to refine clinical/pathological diagnoses into subgroups with more uniform pathology. Despite large changes observed in EOPE, there were challenges in reproducing genome-wide DNAm hits that are discussed.},

  abstract = {Alteration of cancer cell toward mesenchymal phenotype has been shown to potentiate tumor aggressiveness by increasing cancer cell metastasis. Herein, we report the effect of triclosan, a widely used antibacterial agent found in many daily products, in enhancing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in aggressive anoikis resistant human H460 lung cancer cells. EMT has been long known to increase abilities of the cells to increase migration, invasion, and survival in circulating system. The present study reveals that treatment of the cancer cells with triclosan at the physiologically related concentrations significantly increased the colony number of the cancer cells assessed by tumor formation assay. Also, the mesenchymal-like morphology and decrease in cell-to-cell adhesion were observed in triclosan-treated cells. Importantly, western blot analysis revealed that triclosan-treated cells exhibited decreased E-cadherin, while the levels of EMT markers, namely N-cadherin, vimentin, snail and slug were found to be significantly up-regulated. Furthermore, EMT induced by triclosan treatment was accompanied by the activation of focal adhesion kinase/ATP dependent tyrosine kinase (FAK/Akt) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), which enhanced the ability of the cells to migrate and invade. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that triclosan may potentiate cancer cells survival in detached condition and motility via the process of EMT. As mentioned capabilities are required for success in metastasis, the present study provides the novel toxicological information and encourages the awareness of triclosan use in cancer patients.},

Population studies have demonstrated that it penetrates through the skin and crosses the blood-brain barrier. However, little is known about the impact of BP-3 on the nervous system and its possible adverse effects on the developing brain. We demonstrated that the neurotoxic effects of BP-3 were accompanied by the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by apoptosis-related caspase-3 activation and apoptotic body formation as well as the inhibition of autophagy, as determined by the downregulation of autophagy-related genes, decreased autophagosome formation, and reduced LC3B-to-LC3A ratio. In this study, we showed for the first time that the BP-3-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells is mediated via the stimulation of RXR{$\alpha$} signaling and the attenuation of RXR{$\beta$}/RXR{$\gamma$} signaling, as demonstrated using selective antagonist and specific siRNAs as well as by measuring the mRNA and protein expression levels of the receptors. This study also demonstrated that environmentally relevant concentrations of BP-3 were able to inhibit autophagy and disrupt the epigenetic status of neuronal cells, as evidenced by the inhibition of global DNA methylation as well as the reduction of histone deacetylases and histone acetyl transferases activity, which may increase the risks of neurodevelopmental abnormalities and/or neural degenerations.},

Despite widespread exposure, data showing the effects of BP-3 on the developing nervous system are scarce. This study revealed for the first time that prenatal exposure to BP-3 led to apoptosis and neurotoxicity, altered the levels of estrogen receptors (ERs) and changed the epigenetic status of mouse neurons. In the present study, subcutaneous injections of pregnant mice with BP-3 at 50 mg/kg, which is an environmentally relevant dose, evoked activation of caspase-3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as well as substantial loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in neocortical cells of their embryonic offspring. Apoptosis-focused microarray analysis of neocortical cells revealed up-regulation of 22 genes involved in apoptotic cell death. This effect was supported by increased BAX and CASP3 mRNA and protein levels, as evidenced by qPCR, ELISAs and western blots. BP-3-induced apoptosis and neurotoxicity were accompanied by decreases in the mRNA and protein expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2 (also known as ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$}), with a simultaneous increase in GPER1 (also known as GPR30) expression. In addition to the demonstration that treatment of pregnant mice with BP-3 induced apoptosis, caused neurotoxicity and altered ERs expression levels in neocortical cells of their embryonic offspring, we showed that prenatal administration of BP-3 inhibited global DNA methylation as well as reduced DNMTs activity. BP-3 also caused specific hypomethylation of the genes Gper1 and Bax, an effect that was accompanied by increased mRNA and protein expression levels. In addition, BP-3 caused hypermethylation of the genes Esr1, Esr2 and Bcl2, which could explain the reduced mRNA and protein levels of the estrogen receptors. This study demonstrated for the first time that prenatal exposure to BP-3 caused severe neuronal apoptosis that was accompanied by impaired ESR1/ESR2 expression, enhanced GPER1 expression, global DNA hypomethylation and altered methylation statuses of apoptosis-related and ERs genes. We suggest that the effects of BP-3 in embryonic neurons may be the fetal basis of the adult onset of nervous system disease.},

Our study revealed that prenatal exposure to BP-3 (used in environmentally relevant doses) impairs autophagy in terms of BECLIN-1, MAP1LC3B, autophagosomes, and autophagy-related factors; disrupts the levels of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR{$\gamma$}); alters epigenetic status (i.e., attenuates HDAC and sirtuin activities); inhibits post-translational modifications in terms of global sumoylation; and dysregulates expression of neurogenesis- and neurotransmitter-related genes as well as miRNAs involved in pathologies of the nervous system. Our study also showed that BP-3 has good permeability through the BBB. We strongly suggest that BP-3-evoked effects may substantiate a fetal basis of the adult onset of neurological diseases, particularly schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many phthalates and phenols are hormonally active and are suspected to alter the course of development. OBJECTIVE: We investigated prenatal exposures to phthalate and phenol metabolites and their associations with body size measures of the infants at birth. METHODS: We measured 5 phenol and 10 phthalate urinary metabolites in a multiethnic cohort of 404 women in New York City during their third trimester of pregnancy and recorded size of infants at birth. RESULTS: Median urinary concentrations were {$>$} 10 \textmu g/L for 2 of 5 phenols and 6 of 10 phthalate monoester metabolites. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight phthalate monoesters (low-MWP) were approximately 5-fold greater than those of high-molecular-weight metabolites. Low-MWP metabolites had a positive association with gestational age [0.97 day gestational age per ln-biomarker; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.07\textendash 1.9 days, multivariate adjusted] and with head circumference. Higher prenatal exposures to 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP) predicted lower birth weight in boys (\textendash 210 g average birth weight difference between the third tertile and first tertile of 2,5-DCP; 95\% CI, 71\textendash 348 g). Higher maternal benzophenone-3 (BP3) concentrations were associated with a similar decrease in birth weight among girls but with greater birth weight in boys. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a range of phthalate and phenol exposures during pregnancy in our population, but few were associated with birth size. The association of 2,5-DCP and BP3 with reduced or increased birth weight could be important in very early or small-size births. In addition, positive associations of urinary metabolites with some outcomes may be attributable partly to unresolved confounding with maternal anthropometric factors.},

We have examined the methylation of APC gene promoters in human placenta and choriocarcinoma cells. This revealed a general hypomethylation of the APC-1b promoter and a pattern with monoallelic methylation of the APC-1a promoter in full term placental tissue. However, there was no evidence of a parent-of-origin effect, suggesting random post zygotic origin of methylation. Increased methylation of this promoter was observed in all choriocarcinoma-derived trophoblast cell lines, suggesting a trophoblastic origin of placental APC methylation and implicating APC hypermethylation in the development of this group of gestational tumours. Our demonstration of placental methylation of the APC-1a promoter represents the first observation of monoallelic methylation of this gene in early development, and provides further support for a role of canonical Wnt signalling in placental trophoblast invasiveness. This also implicates tumour suppressor gene silencing as an integral part of normal human placental development.},

  abstract = {Multiple imputation is a popular technique for analysing incomplete data. Given the imputed data and a particular model, Rubin's rules (RR) for estimating parameters and standard errors are well established. However, there are currently no guidelines for variable selection in multiply imputed data sets. The usual practice is to perform variable selection amongst the complete cases, a simple but inefficient and potentially biased procedure. Alternatively, variable selection can be performed by repeated use of RR, which is more computationally demanding. An approximation can be obtained by a simple `stacked' method that combines the multiply imputed data sets into one and uses a weighting scheme to account for the fraction of missing data in each covariate. We compare these and other approaches using simulations based around a trial in community psychiatry. Most methods improve on the na\textasciidieresis\i ve complete-case analysis for variable selection, but importantly the type 1 error is only preserved if selection is based on RR, which is our recommended approach.

A pilot study conducted in three provinces in Thailand measured maternal urinary metabolites of OP pesticides in pregnant women at 7~months gestation and at birth. Within 3~days of birth, 82 newborns underwent neurobehavioral testing using the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). Comparison of the NBAS test results with maternal OP metabolite levels found the neonates NBAS Habituation cluster score increased with maternal dimethylphosphate (DMP) levels (p~=~0.04) while the Range of State score increased with total diethylphosphate (DEP) levels (p~=~0.01). The Number of Abnormal Reflexes in the neonate also increased as maternal urinary total DEP levels increased (p~=~0.06). These preliminary findings suggest that pre-natal exposures to OP pesticides can impact newborn neurodevelopment and support the need for a longitudinal evaluation of childhood neurodevelopment in relation to pesticide exposures in Thailand.},

A pathway-based analysis may shed light by projecting candidate genes onto protein functional relationship networks. We are building such a pathway-based analysis system. RESULTS: We have constructed a protein functional interaction network by extending curated pathways with non-curated sources of information, including protein-protein interactions, gene coexpression, protein domain interaction, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and text-mined protein interactions, which cover close to 50\% of the human proteome. By applying this network to two glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data sets and projecting cancer candidate genes onto the network, we found that the majority of GBM candidate genes form a cluster and are closer than expected by chance, and the majority of GBM samples have sequence-altered genes in two network modules, one mainly comprising genes whose products are localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane, and another comprising gene products in the nucleus. Both modules are highly enriched in known oncogenes, tumor suppressors and genes involved in signal transduction. Similar network patterns were also found in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We have built a highly reliable functional interaction network upon expert-curated pathways and applied this network to the analysis of two genome-wide GBM and several other cancer data sets. The network patterns revealed from our results suggest common mechanisms in the cancer biology. Our system should provide a foundation for a network or pathway-based analysis platform for cancer and other diseases.},

To date, few epidemiological studies regarding repeated paraben measurements during pregnancy associated with fetal and childhood growth have been conducted. Within a Chinese prenatal cohort, 850 mother-infant pairs from whom a complete set of maternal urine samples were acquired during three trimesters were included, and the levels of five parabens were measured. We assessed the associations of both average and trimester-specific urinary paraben levels with weight and height z-scores at birth, 6 months, 1, and 2 years of age. In all infants, each doubling increase in average ethyl paraben (EtP) was associated with -2.82\% (95\% CI: -5.11\%, -0.53\%) decrease in weight z-score at birth, whereas no significant age-specific associations were identified. After stratifying by sex, we further observed age-specific association of average EtP with -3.96\% (95\% CI: -7.03\%, -0.89\%) and -3.38\% (95\% CI: 6.72\%, -0.03\%) reduction in weight z-scores at 1 and 2 years in males, respectively. Third-trimester EtP was negatively associated with weight z-scores at birth, 1 and 2 years in males. Our results suggested negative associations between prenatal paraben exposure and fetal and childhood growth, and the third trimester may be the window of susceptibility.},

Leptin and leptin receptor expression were also significantly higher, but were only associated with BPA.

Appropriate data preprocessing to remove background noise is important for detecting the small changes that may be associated with disease. We developed a novel background correction method, ENmix, that uses a mixture of exponential and truncated normal distributions to flexibly model signal intensity and uses a truncated normal distribution to model background noise. Depending on data availability, we employ three approaches to estimate background normal distribution parameters using (i) internal chip negative controls, (ii) out-of-band Infinium I probe intensities or (iii) combined methylated and unmethylated intensities. We evaluate ENmix against other available methods for both reproducibility among duplicate samples and accuracy of methylation measurement among laboratory control samples. ENmix out-performed other background correction methods for both these measures and substantially reduced the probe-design type bias between Infinium I and II probes. In reanalysis of existing EWAS data we show that ENmix can identify additional CpGs, and results in smaller P-value estimates for previously-validated CpGs. We incorporated the method into R package ENmix, which is freely available from Bioconductor website.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying maternal Cd toxicity on fetal growth remain largely unknown. Specifically, the expression profiles and the regulation mechanisms of the imprinted genes, have been poorly characterized in the etiology of Cd-induced fetal growth restriction (FGR). In the present study, 13 imprinted genes associated with the fetal growth and placenta development were selected and their expression patterns were examined in the Cd-exposed placentas. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot results showed that the maternally expressed gene, Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1c (Cdkn1c), and paternally expressed gene, Paternally expressed gene 10 (Peg10), were significantly upregulated and downregulated respectively in the Cd-exposed placentas when compared to the normal ones respectively. Moreover, data from bisulfate PCR demonstrated the changes of the methylation levels of the promoter regions of Cdkn1c and Peg10 in the Cd-exposed placentas. In addition, the expression profile of Cdkn1c was correlated with the methylation levels of site 2 (-837--692) but not site 1 (-389--185) of its promoter region. Therefore, our results suggest that changes of the DNA methylation levels of the promoter regions and the expression patterns of Cdkn1c and Peg10 may be involved in the etiology of Cd-induced fetal growth restriction.},

  abstract = {Background: H19 and IGF2 genes are imprinted and involved in regulating fetal and placental growth. The H19 differentially methylated region (DMR) is paternally methylated and maternally unmethylated and regulates the imprinted expression of H19 and IGF2. Epimutation at the H19-DMR in humans results in congenital growth disorders, Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes, when erroneously its maternal allele becomes methylated and its paternal allele becomes unmethylated, respectively. Although H19 and IGF2 have been assessed for their involvement in pregnancy complications including fetal growth restriction (FGR) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH)/ hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) intensively in the last decade, it is still not established whether epimutation at the H19-DMR in the placenta results in pathogenic conditions in pregnancy. We aimed to assess the frequency of H19-DMR epimutation and its effects on the allelic expression patterns of H19 and IGF2 genes among normal and abnormal pregnancy cases. Results: We enrolled two independently collected sets of placenta samples from normal pregnancies as controls and common pregnancy complications, FGR and PIH (HDP). The first set consisted of 39 controls and 140 FGR and/or PIH cases, and the second set consisted of 29 controls and 62 cases. For these samples, we initially screened for DNA methylation changes at H19-DMR and IGF2-DMRs by combined bisulfite restriction analysis, and further analyzed cases with methylation changes for their allelic methylation and expression patterns. We identified one case each of FGR and PIH showing hypomethylation of H19-DMR and IGF2-DMRs only in the placenta, but not in cord blood, from the first case/control set. For the PIH case, we were able to determine the allelic expression pattern of H19 to be biallelically expressed and the H19/IGF2 expression ratio to be highly elevated compared to controls. We also identified a PIH case with hypomethylation at H19-DMR and IGF2-DMRs in the placenta from the second case/control set. Conclusions: Placental epimutation at H19-DMR was observed among common pregnancy complication cases at the frequency of 1.5\% (3 out of 202 cases examined), but not in 68 normal pregnancy cases examined. Alteration of H19/IGF2 expression patterns due to hypomethylation of H19-DMR may have been involved in the pathogenesis of pregnancy complications in these cases.},

DBP exposure has been reported to be responsible for neurobehavioral effects and related neurological diseases. In this study, we found that neurobehavioral changes induced by DBP may be mediated by oxidative damage in the mouse brain, and that the co-administration of Mangiferin (MAG, 50mg/kg/day) may protect the brain against oxidative damage caused by DBP exposure. The results of ethological analysis (elevated plus maze test and open-field test), histopathological examination of the brain, and assessments of oxidative stress (OS) in the mouse brain showed that there is a link between oxidative stress and anxiety-like behavior produced by DBP at higher doses (25 or 125mg/kg/day). Biomarkers of oxidative stress encompass reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and DPC coefficients (DPC).

To minimize the impact of batch effects, an ideal experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. However, due to the practical complications, the availability of the final collection of samples in genomics study might be unbalanced and incomplete, which, without appropriate attention in sample-to-batch allocation, could lead to drastic batch effects. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective and handy tool to assign collected samples across batches in an appropriate way in order to minimize the impact of batch effects. Results: We describe OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment Tool), a bioconductor package designed for automated sample-to-batch allocations in genomics experiments. Conclusions: OSAT is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different batches in genomics study. Through optimizing the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, it can reduce the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest. It can also optimize the homogeneous distribution of confounding factors across batches. It can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideally balanced designs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemical in our daily life, and its health effect in response to prenatal exposure is still controversial. Early-life BPA exposure may impact brain development and contribute to childhood neurological disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate molecular target genes of neuronal development in trans-placental exposure to BPA. METHODOLOGY: A meta-analysis of three public microarray datasets was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in exposure to BPA. The candidate genes of neuronal development were identified from gene ontology analysis in a reconstructed neuronal sub-network, and their gene expressions were determined using real-time PCR in 20 umbilical cord blood samples dichotomized into high and low BPA level groups upon the median 16.8 nM. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 36 neuronal transcripts sorted from DAVID ontology clusters of 457 DEGs using the analysis of Bioconductor limma package, we found two neuronal genes, sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2) and paired box 6 (Pax6), had preferentially down-regulated expression (Bonferroni correction p-value {$<$}10(-4) and log2-transformed fold change {$\leq$}-1.2) in response to BPA exposure. Fetal cord blood samples had the obviously attenuated gene expression of Sox2 and Pax6 in high BPA group referred to low BPA group. Visualized gene network of Cytoscape analysis showed that Sox2 and Pax6 which were contributed to neural precursor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation might be down-regulated through sonic hedgehog (Shh), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and Notch signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that trans-placental BPA exposure down-regulated gene expression of Sox2 and Pax6 potentially underlying the adverse effect on childhood neuronal development.},

The PCR product, which represents a pool of approximately 15 000 genomic loci, could be used for direct sequencing, selective restriction digestion or pyrosequencing, in order to quantitate DNA methylation. By restriction digestion or pyrosequencing, the assay was reproducible with a standard deviation of only 2\% between assays. Using this method we found that almost two-thirds of the CpG methylation sites in Alu elements are mutated, but of the remaining methylation target sites, 87\% were methylated. Due to the heavy methylation of repetitive elements, this assay was especially useful in detecting decreases in DNA methylation, and this assay was validated by examining cell lines treated with the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2\textcent deoxycytidine (DAC), where we found a 1{$\pm$}16\% decrease in Alu element and 18{$\pm$}60\% LINE methylation within 3 days of treatment. This method can be used as a surrogate marker of genome-wide methylation changes. In addition, it is less labor intensive and requires less DNA than previous methods of assessing global DNA methylation.},

  abstract = {Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) remain one of the most commonly used pesticides, and their detection rates and residues in agricultural products, foods and environmental samples have been underestimated. Humans and environmental organisms are at high risk of exposure to OPs. Most OPs can be degraded and metabolized into dialkyl phosphates (DAPs) in organisms and the environment, and can be present in urine as biomarkers for exposure to OPs, of which diethyl phosphate (DEP) is a high-exposure metabolite. Epidemiological and cohort studies have found that DAPs are associated with endocrine hormone disorders, especially sex hormone disorders and thyroid hormone disorders, but there has been no direct causal evidence to support these findings. Our study explored the effects of chronic exposure to DEP on endocrine hormones and related metabolic indicators in adult male rats at actual doses that can be reached in the human body. The results showed that chronic exposure to DEP could cause thyroid-related hormone disorders in the serum of rats, causing symptoms of hyperthyroidism in rats, and could also lead to abnormal expression of thyroid hormone-related genes in the rat liver. However, DEP exposure did not seem to affect serum sex hormone levels, spermatogenesis or sperm quality in rats. The molecular interactions between DEP and thyroid hormone-related enzymes/proteins were investigated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics methods in silico. It was found that DEP could strongly interact with thyroid hormone biosynthesis, blood transport, receptor binding and metabolism-related enzymes/proteins, interfering with the production and signal regulation of thyroid hormones. In vivo and in silico experiments showed that DEP might be a potential thyroid hormone-disrupting chemical, and therefore, we need to be more cautious and rigorous regarding organophosphorus chemical exposure.},

This study investigated the associations between phthalate exposure during the first trimester and thyroid hormones in pregnant women and their newborns. Pregnant women were enrolled from the prospective Ma'anshan Birth Cohort study in China. A standard questionnaire was completed by the women at the first antenatal visit. Seven phthalate metabolites were measured in one-spot urine at enrolment (10.0 {$\pm$} 2.1 gestational weeks), as were thyroid hormone levels in maternal and cord sera. Multivariable linear regression showed that 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in natural log (ln)-transformed mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) was associated with 0.163 mg/dL (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001) and 0.173 mg/dL (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001) decreases in maternal total thyroxine (TT4).

An inverse association was observed between monobenzyl phthalate and maternal TT4 and FT4. A 1-SD increase in ln-transformed monoethyl phthalate was inversely associated with maternal TT4 (b: \`A0.151, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.002). By contrast, the concentrations of phthalate metabolites in urine were not associated with those of thyroid hormone in cord serum.

Results: Prenatal exposure to BPA was not significantly associated with neurobehavioral outcomes at 5 weeks. Significant associations between prenatal exposure to measured phthalates and infant neurobehavioral outcomes differed by type of phthalate and were only seen with exposure measured at 26 weeks. Higher total di-butyl phthalate (DBP) metabolites at 26w were associated with improved behavioral organization evidenced by decreased arousal (p= .04), increased self-regulation (p= .052), and decreased handling (p= .02). In males, higher total di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites at 26w were associated with more nonoptimal reflexes (p= .02). Conclusion: The association between prenatal phthalate exposure and infant neurobehavior differed by type of phthalate and was evident only with exposure measured at 26w. Prenatal exposure to DBP was associated with improved behavioral organization in 5-week-old infants. Prenatal exposure to DEHP was associated with nonoptimal reflexes in male infants.

Yet confounding from population stratification is often unaccounted for in DNAme association studies. Existing approaches to address confounding by population stratification using DNAme data may not generalize to populations or tissues outside those in which they were developed. To aid future placental DNAme studies in assessing population stratification, we developed an ethnicity classifier, PlaNET (               Pla               cental DNAme Elastic               N               et               E               thnicity               T               ool), using five cohorts with Infinium Human Methylation 450k BeadChip array (HM450k) data from placental samples that is also compatible with the newer EPIC platform.                                                Results             Data from 509 placental samples was used to develop PlaNET and show that it accurately predicts (accuracy = 0.938, kappa = 0.823) major classes of self-reported ethnicity/race (African: n = 58, Asian: n = 53, Caucasian: n = 389), and produces ethnicity probabilities that are highly correlated with genetic ancestry inferred from genome-wide SNP arrays ({$>$}2.5 million SNP) and ancestry informative markers (n = 50 SNPs). PlaNET's ethnicity classification relies on 1860 HM450K microarray sites, and over half of these were linked to nearby genetic polymorphisms (n = 955). Our placental-optimized method outperforms existing approaches in assessing population stratification in placental samples from individuals of Asian, African, and Caucasian ethnicities.                                   Conclusion                            PlaNET provides an improved approach to address population stratification in placental DNAme association studies. The method can be applied to predict ethnicity as a discrete or continuous variable and will be especially useful when self-reported ethnicity information is missing and genotyping markers are unavailable.

Although multiple studies have investigated gene expression changes in these disorders, few studies have examined epigenetic changes. Analysis of the DNA methylation pattern associated with such pregnancies provides an alternative approach to identifying cellular changes involved in these disorders. We analyzed methylation of 1505 CpG sites associated with 807 genes in 26 placentas from early-onset preeclampsia (EOPET), late-onset preeclampsia, IUGR and control subjects using an Illumina GoldenGate Methylation panel. Thirty-four loci were hypomethylated (false discovery rate {$<$}10\% and methylation difference {$>$}10\%) in the early-onset preeclamptic placentas while no and only five differentially methylated loci were found in late-onset preeclamptic and IUGR placentas, respectively. Hypomethylation of 4 loci in EOPET was further confirmed by bisulfite pyrosequencing of 26 independent placental samples. The promoter of TIMP3 was confirmed to be significantly hypomethylated in EOPET placentas (P=0.00001).

Imprinted genes are typically associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) whereby one of the two alleles is DNA methylated depending on the parent of origin. Identifying imprinted DMRs in humans is complicated by species- and tissue-specific differences in imprinting status and the presence of multiple regulatory regions associated with a particular gene, only some of which may be imprinted. In this study, we have taken advantage of the unbalanced parental genomic constitutions in triploidies to further characterize human DMRs associated with known imprinted genes and identify novel imprinted DMRs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of human tissue is influenced by a combination of intrinsic biological signals and extrinsic environmental stimuli, both of which are mediated by epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation. However, little is currently known of the normal acquisition or loss of epigenetic markers during fetal and postnatal development. RESULTS: The DNA methylation status of over 1000 CpGs located in the regulatory regions of nearly 800 genes was evaluated in five somatic tissues (brain, kidney, lung, muscle and skin) from eight normal second-trimester fetuses. Tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) were identified in 195 such loci. However, comparison with corresponding data from trisomic fetuses (five trisomy 21 and four trisomy 18) revealed relatively few DNA methylation differences associated with trisomy, despite such conditions having a profound effect on development. Of interest, only 17\% of the identified fetal tDMRs were found to maintain this same tissue-specific DNA methylation in adult tissues. Furthermore, 10\% of the sites analyzed, including sites associated with imprinted genes, had a DNA methylation difference of {$>$}40\% between fetus and adult. This plasticity of DNA methylation over development was further confirmed by comparison with similar data from embryonic stem cells, with the most altered methylation levels being linked to domains with bivalent histone modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Most fetal tDMRs seem to reflect transient DNA methylation changes during development rather than permanent epigenetic signatures. The extensive tissue-specific and developmental-stage specific nature of DNA methylation will need to be elucidated to identify abnormal patterns of DNA methylation associated with abnormal development or disease.},

However, whether or how tumor suppressor gene methylation changed in HepG2 cells after low-dose and long-term TCS exposure is still unknown. We investigate here the effects and mechanisms of DNA methylation of global DNA(GDM), repetitive genes, and liver tumor suppressor gene (p16) after exposing HepG2 cells to low-dose TCS (0.625\textendash 5 nM)for two weeks using HPLC\textendash MS/MS, Methylight, Q-MSP, Pyrosequencing, and Massarray methods. We found that low-dose TCS exposure decreased repetitive elements LINE-1 methylation levels, but not global DNA methylation, through down-regulating DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) and MeCP2 (methylated DNA binding domain) expression, and up-regulating 8-hydroxy2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels. Interestingly, low-dose TCS elevated p16 gene methylation and inhibited p16 expression, which were not observed in high-dose (10 {$\mu$}M) group. Meanwhile, methyl-triclosan could not induce these two types of DNA methylation changes, suggesting the involvement of hydroxyl in TCS-mediated DNA methylation changes. Collectively, our results suggested low concentrations of TCS adversely affected HepG2 cells through DNA methylation dysregulation, and hydroxyl group in TCS played an important role in the effects. This study provided a better understanding on hepatotoxicity of TCS at environmentally relevant concentrations through epigenetic pathway.},

We investigated whether certain months or seasons of conception are associated with increased risk of autism spectrum disorders, for which etiology is particularly obscure. Methods\textemdash The study population comprises 6,604,975 children born from 1990 to 2002 in California. Autism cases (n = 19,238) were identified from 1990 through 2008 in databases of the California Department of Developmental Service, which coordinates services for people with developmental disorders. The outcome in this analysis was autism diagnosed before the child's sixth birth date. The main independent variables were month of conception and season of conception (winter, spring, summer, and fall). Multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for autism by month of conception. Results\textemdash Children conceived in December (OR = 1.09 [95\% CI = 1.02 \textendash{} 1.17]), January (1.08 [1.00 \textendash 1.17]), February (1.12 [1.04\textendash{} 1.20]), or March (1.16 [1.08 \textendash{} 1.24]) had higher risk of developing autism compared with those conceived in July. Conception in the winter season (December, January, and February) was associated with a 6\% (OR = 1.06, 95\% CI = 1.02 \textendash{} 1.10) increased risk compared with summer. Conclusions\textemdash Higher risks for autism among those conceived in winter months suggest the presence of environmental causes of autism that vary by season.},

Our previous study found that the alteration of the expression of AQPs 1, 3, 8, and 9 in placenta and fetal membranes was an adaptive response to maintain amniotic fluid homeostasis in case of abnormal amniotic fluid volume, which is likely to affect the intramembranous absorption and transport of water and solute from mother to fetus. However, the actual regulation mechanisms of intramembranous absorption and placental water flow are not yet clear, making it difficult to treat abnormal amniotic fluid volume effectively. Several studies found that many factors, including hormone levels, osmotic pressure, temperature, and oxygen concentration, regulate expression of AQPs in placenta, fetal membranes, and other mammalian organs through several signal transduction pathways, such as the cAMP, the MAPK, the PI3K/AKT, and the PKC pathways. These factors could provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of abnormal amniotic fluid volume.},

Among all adults, urinary BP-3 concentrations were significantly (p{$<$}0.001) positively correlated with urinary BP-1 concentrations. Nevertheless, no significant correlations were found between urinary concentrations of BP-3 (or BP-1) and 4OH-BP. Our results suggest that human exposure to BP-3 and BP-1 is related, whereas 4OH-BP originates from a discrete source. Females had higher urinary concentrations of BP-3, BP-1 and 4OH-BP than males. The distribution profiles of BP-1 and its parent compound (i.e., BP-3) in urine decreased with increasing age of donors (p{$<$}0.05). The ratio of concentrations of BP-3 between blood and urine was 0.21 in adults, which was significantly lower than that for 4OH-BP (0.36). The concentration ratio of BPs between cord blood and maternal blood was higher for 4OH-BP (0.61) than that for BP-3 (0.48), which suggested greater trans-placental transfer potential of 4OH-BP.

However, the level of exposure to OPs in China is still uncertain. Objective To investigate the effect of the exposure to OPs on the neonatal neurodevelopment during pregnancy in Shenyang, China. Methods 249 pregnant women enrolled in the Central Hospital Affiliated to Shenyang Medical College from February 2011 to August 2012. A cohort of the mothers and their neonates participated in the study and information on each subject was obtained by questionnaire. Dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites were detected in the urine of mothers during pregnancy to evaluate the exposure level to OPs. Neonate neurobehavioral developmental levels were assessed according to the standards of the Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA). Multiple linear regressions were utilized to analyze the association between pregnancy exposure to OPs and neonatal neurobehavioral development. Results The geometric means (GM) of urinary metabolites for dimethyl phosphate (DMP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), and diethyl thiophosphate (DETP) in pregnant women were 18.03, 8.53, 7.14, and 5.64 \textmu g/L, respectively. Results from multiple linear regressions showed that prenatal OP exposure was one of the most important factors affecting NBNA scores. Prenatal total DAP concentrations were inversely associated with scores on the NBNA scales.?Additionally, a 10-fold increase in DAP concentrations was associated with a decrease of 1.78 regarding the Summary NBNA (95\% CI, -2.12 to -1.45). And there was an estimated 2.11-point difference in summary NBNA scores between neonates in the highest quintile of prenatal OP exposure and the lowest quintile group. Conclusion The high exposure of pregnant women to OPs in Shenyang, China was the predominant risk factor for neonatal neurobehavioral development.},

Although epigenetic status in placenta is linked to fetal development, the mechanism behind this remains unknown. Because of the importance of DNA methylation in gene function, we set to explore whether or not DNA methylation in human placenta is also linked to fetal NTDs. Here we show for the first time that alteration of DNA methylation in placenta is closely associated with the phenotypes of fetal spina bifida (Sb). We found that patterns of DNA methylation for genes in neurological system process were differentially altered in the Sb placenta. In particular, the transcription regulatory regions of TRIM26 and GANS were kept at the hypomethylation status in Sb placenta alone. Accordingly, the protein levels of TRIM26 and GNAS were significantly elevated only in the Sb placenta but not in the Sb-affected fetuses. In cellular model of CHO cells deficient in Dihydrofolate reductase and treated with 5-aza-2{${'}$}-deoxycytidine, the protein levels of GNAS and TRIM26 were significantly higher than those in normal control cells. These findings suggested that epigenetic status of genes in placenta have profound impacts on the development of NTDs.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Triclosan is widely used in personal care products for its broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects, but triclosan is a potential endocrine disruptor. 11{$\beta$}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11{$\beta$}-HSD2) is a cortisol-inactivating enzyme that is highly expressed in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts to ensure normal fetal development in the presence of high levels of maternal cortisol in pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of triclosan on 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 and apoptosis and the relationship between these two events in human placental syncytiotrophoblasts. DESIGN: Primary human placental cytotrophoblasts were isolated from term placenta. After syncytialization, the levels of 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 and apoptosis-related proteins including caspase3, Bcl-2, and Bax were examined after treatment with triclosan from 0.001 {$\mu$}M to 10 {$\mu$}M or triclosan (0.1 {$\mu$}M) in the presence and absence of apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (30 {$\mu$}M) for 24 h. RESULTS: Triclosan inhibited 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 mRNA, protein and activity levels in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.001 to 10 {$\mu$}M with a significant inhibition at 0.01 {$\mu$}M and above. Concurrently, triclosan induced apoptosis of human placental syncytiotrophoblasts as demonstrated by observations of increased nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation and pro-apoptosis proteins such as Bax and cleaved-caspase3, decreased pro-caspase-3 and anti-apoptosis protein such as Bcl-2. Blocking apoptosis with Z-VAD-FMK attenuated the inhibition of 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 by triclosan significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Triclosan may attenuate the expression of placental 11{$\beta$}-HSD2 via the induction of apoptosis of placental syncytiotrophoblasts. This is likely to disrupt the placental glucocorticoid barrier and impair fetal development.},

The aim of this study is to identify the diagnostic and poor prognostic signatures in TNBC by exploring the aberrant DNA methylation and gene expression. Differential expression and methylation analysis of the TNBC and paracancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas were performed. Gene set enrichment and protein\textendash protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was used to explore the mechanisms of TNBC. Methylation-gene expression correlation analysis was performed, and multivariate Cox analysis and receiver operating characteristics analysis were used to further screen the hub genes for TNBC. We identified 1,525 differentially expressed genes and 150 differentially methylated genes between TNBC and paracancer samples. About 96.64\% of the methylation sites were located on the CpG island. A total of 17 Gene Ontology biological process terms and 18 signal pathways were significantly enriched. GNG4, GNG11, PENK, MAOA, and AOX1 were identified as the core genes of the PPI network. Methylation-expression correlations revealed that ABCC9 (cg06951626), NKAPL (cg18675097, cg01031101, and cg17384889), and TMEM132C (cg03530754) showed promise as diagnostic and prognostic markers in TNBC. ABCC9 (cg06951626), NKAPL (cg18675097, cg01031101, and cg17384889), and TMEM132C (cg03530754) were potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in TNBC.},

Methods Eighty pregnant women (7\textendash 41 gestational weeks) including normal pregnant women (60 cases) and pre-eclamptic pregnant women (20 cases) were selected as study groups and 20 normal non-pregnant women were selected as control group. Free DNA of plasma samples was extracted, and RASSF1A levels before and after double-methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion of HinP1I and HhaI were determined to measure total and fetal cell-free DNA, respectively. {$\beta$}-Actin gene was detected as a control to confirm complete enzyme digestion. Results The median concentrations of hypermethylated RASSF1A gene were 46 copies/mL in first trimester, 96 copies/mL in second trimester, 527 copies/mL in third trimester and 1947 copies/mL in pre-eclampsia. There was positive correlation between fetal-derived hypermethylated RASSF1A levels and the severity of pre-eclampsia.

Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation might be a molecular mechanism through which phthalate exposure affects fetal growth. In this study, we examined associations between prenatal phthalate exposure, infant growth, and global DNA methylation in human placenta samples. We measured global DNA methylation of 119 subjects [55 fetal growth restriction (FGR) cases and 64 normal controls], as assessed by long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, via quantitative polymerase chain reaction-pyrosequencing. Prenatal phthalate exposure was assessed by measuring maternal urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and SumDEHP (molar sum of MEHP, MEHHP, and MEOHP) were significantly higher in FGR cases than those in normal controls (P = 0.002, 0.003, and 0.002, respectively). Placental LINE-1 methylation were found to be positively associated with fetal birth weight standard deviation scores, and negatively associated with urinary phthalate metabolites concentrations (MEHHP and SumDEHP). Every natural-log unit increase in urinary concentrations of MEHHP and SumDEHP was associated with 0.015 ({$\beta$} = -0.015, P = 0.150) and 0.012 kg ({$\beta$} = -0.012, P = 0.167) decrease in birth weight mediated through LINE-1 methylation. These findings suggest that changes in placental LINE-1 methylation might be part of the underlying biological pathway between prenatal phthalate exposure and adverse fetal growth. Environ. Mol.

  abstract = {New high throughput technologies are now enabling simultaneous epigenetic profiling of DNA methylation at hundreds of thousands of CpGs across the genome. A problem of considerable practical interest is identification of large scale, global changes in methylation that are associated with environmental variables, clinical outcomes, or other experimental conditions. However, there has been little statistical research on methods for global methylation analysis using technologies with individual CpG resolution. To address this critical gap in the literature, we develop a new strategy for global analysis of methylation profiles using a functional regression approach wherein we approximate either the density or the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the methylation values for each individual using B-spline basis functions. The spline coefficients for each individual are allowed to summarize the individual's overall methylation profile. We then test for association between the overall distribution and a continuous or dichotomous outcome variable using a variance component score test that naturally accommodates the correlation between spline coefficients. Simulations indicate that our proposed approach has desirable power while protecting type I error. The method was applied to detect methylation differences, both genome wide and at LINE1 elements, between the blood samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls and to detect the epigenetic changes of human hepatocarcinogenesis in the context of alcohol abuse and hepatitis C virus infection. A free implementation of our methods in the R language is available in the Global Analysis of Methylation Profiles (GAMP) package at http://research.fhcrc.org/wu/en.html.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The homeostasis of maternal-fetal fluid exchange is critically important in pregnancy. We sought to investigate the function of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) during pregnancy by examining fluid compartments of AQP1 knockout (AQP1-KO) mice. METHODS: Homozygous pregnant AQP1 knockout (KO) mice and control pregnant wild type CD1 mice were sacrificed. Placenta and fetal membranes were examined by immunohistochemical staining for expression of AQP1. The total number of embryos, atrophic embryos, and fetal and placental weight was recorded in each subgroup. Amniotic fluid amount in each sac was measured and amniotic fluid composition was determined. Analysis of variance of factorial design and one-factor analysis of variance were used for statistics. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry performed on CD1, though not AQP1-KO, placenta revealed that AQP1 was expressed at the vascular endothelial cell, trophocyte, and amnion epithelial cell. In AQP1-KOs, the number of embryos decreased with advancing gestational age. Although the fetal weight of AQP1-KO mice was significantly lower than wild type, amniotic fluid amount was increased in AQP1-KO mice. The AQP1-KO placenta demonstrated increased degeneration with evidence of altered blood vessel structure and increased syncytiotrophoblast nodules. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a critical role of AQP1 in placental and fetal growth and maternal-fetal fluid homeostasis.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation in repetitive elements (RE) suppresses their mobility and maintains genomic stability, and decreases in it are frequently observed in tumor and/or surrogate tissues. Averaging methylation across RE in genome is widely used to quantify global methylation. However, methylation may vary in specific RE and play diverse roles in disease development, thus averaging methylation across RE may lose significant biological information. The ambiguous mapping of short reads by and high cost of current bisulfite sequencing platforms make them impractical for quantifying locus-specific RE methylation. Although microarray-based approaches (particularly Illumina's Infinium methylation arrays) provide cost-effective and robust genome-wide methylation quantification, the number of interrogated CpGs in RE remains limited. We report a random forest-based algorithm (and corresponding R package, REMP) that can accurately predict genome-wide locus-specific RE methylation based on Infinium array profiling data. We validated its prediction performance using alternative sequencing and microarray data. Testing its clinical utility with The Cancer Genome Atlas data demonstrated that our algorithm offers more comprehensively extended locus-specific RE methylation information that can be readily applied to large human studies in a cost-effective manner. Our work has the potential to improve our understanding of the role of global methylation in human diseases, especially cancer.},

We investigated whether maternal exposure to the EDCs phthalates and personal care products alters the miRNA profile of placental-derived EVs circulating in maternal blood. Blood and urine samples from pregnant women with uncomplicated term dichorionic, diamniotic twin pregnancies were analyzed as part of a larger study investigating correlations between exposure of phthalate and personal care products and epigenetic alterations in twin pregnancies. We explored correlations between maternal urinary levels of 13 phthalate and 12 personal care products metabolites and the miRNA profile of placental EVs (EV-miRNAs) circulating in maternal blood. The expression of miR-518e was highest among women with high urinary levels of monobenzyl phthalate and methyl paraben. miR-373-3p was the least expressed in women exposed to high levels of methyl paraben, and miR-543 was significantly downregulated in women exposed to high levels of paraben metabolites, dichlorophenol metabolites, and triclosan. In conclusion, this pilot study reveals that prenatal exposure to EDCs is associated with altered profile of circulating placenta-derived EV-miRNAs. Further studies are needed to generalize these results to singleton pregnancies and to assess whether these alterations are associated with pregnancy complications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is concern over the potential placental effects of prenatal phthalate exposure, and the potential adverse effects of prenatal phthalate exposure require further study; however, few data are available in humans. We investigated the associations between phthalate exposure in each trimester and both placental size and shape at birth. METHODS: We measured the urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites among 2725 pregnant women in the Ma'anshan Birth Cohort. Before collecting urine samples from each of the three trimesters, the pregnant women were interviewed via questionnaires. Placental information was obtained from hospital records. We estimated the sex-specific associations between urinary phthalate concentrations in each trimester and both placental size and shape at birth using adjusted multiple regression. A linear mixed model was used for the repeated measures analysis with subject-specific random intercepts and slopes for gestational age at sample collection to test the effect of phthalate levels on placental size and shape and to estimate the effect sizes. RESULTS: Overall, placental breadth increased by 0.148cm (95\% CI: 0.078, 0.218) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MBP in the first trimester. The difference between placental length and breadth (length-breadth) decreased by 0.086cm (95\% CI: -0.159, -0.012) and 0.149cm (95\% CI: -0.221, -0.076) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MMP and MBP, respectively, in the first trimester. In the second trimester, placental thickness increased by 0.017cm (95\% CI: 0.006, 0.027), 0.020cm (95\% CI: 0.004, 0.036), 0.028cm (95\% CI: 0.007, 0.048), and 0.035cm (95\% CI: 0.018, 0.053) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MMP, MBP, MEOHP, and MEHHP, respectively. In the third trimester, placental thickness increased by 0.037cm (95\% CI: 0.019, 0.056) and 0.019cm (95\% CI: 0, 0.037) with each 1 ln-concentration increase in MBP and MEHP, respectively. Multiple linear regression for each offspring sex indicated that prenatal phthalate exposure increased placental thickness in both the first and second trimesters in males, whereas the corresponding relationship was close to null in females. Linear mixed models (LMMs) yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the presence of associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and placental size and shape. Exposure to certain phthalates may cause the placenta to become thicker and more circular. Associations appeared stronger for the subsample representing male offspring than those for the subsample representing female offspring. Given the few studies on this topic, additional research is warranted.},

  abstract = {PROM is one of the common complications of perinatal period, which seriously threatens the mother and newborn. The purpose of this study was to identify the role of NLRC4 inflammasomes in this process and their underlying mechanisms. We performed high-throughput RNA sequencing of fetal membrane tissue from 3 normal pregnant women and 3 term-premature rupture of fetal membrane (TPROM) patients who met the inclusion criteria, and found that NLRC4 was significantly up-regulated in TPROM patients. An observational study of TPROM patients (PROM group, n = 30) and normal pregnant women (control group, n = 30) was performed at the Xuzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital affiliated to Xuzhou Medical University from May 2018 to May 2019. The expression of genes involved in inflammasome complex including NLRC1, NLRC3, AIM2, NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, IL-6, IL-18 and IL-1{$\beta$}was determined via real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Measurement of NLRC4 level in serum was conducted by ELISA assay. The results showed that the NLRC4, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-18 levels in fetal membrane, placental tissues and maternal serum were markedly higher in the PROM group than that in the control group. In conclusion, NLRC4 is a markedly up-regulated gene in TPROM fetal membrane tissue, suggesting that NLRC4 is involved in the occurrence and development of TPROM; NLRC4 levels in maternal blood serum are closely related to TPROM and have the potential to assist doctors in predicting and diagnosing PROM.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A analogues (BPAs) belong to a wide variety of large volume chemicals with diverse applications yet emerging environmental concerns. Limited experimental data have demonstrated that BPAs with different halogenation patterns distinctly affect the agonistic activities toward proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR){$\gamma$} and estrogen receptors (ER){$\alpha$}. Understanding the modes of action of BPAs toward different receptors is essential, however, the underlying molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. Here we probed the molecular recognition process of halogenated BPAs including TBBPA, TCBPA, BPAF, BPC, triBBPA, diBBPA, and monoBBPA toward PPAR{$\gamma$} and ER{$\alpha$} by molecular modeling, especially the impact of different halogen patterns. Increasing bromination at phenolic rings of BPAs was found highly correlated with electrostatic interactions (R2 = 0.978 and 0.865 toward PPAR{$\gamma$} and ER{$\alpha$}, respectively) and van der Waals interactions (R2 = 0.995 and 0.994 toward PPAR{$\gamma$} and ER{$\alpha$}, respectively). More halogenated phenolic rings at 3,5-positions of BPAs increase the shielding of the hormonally active phenolic OH and markedly decrease electrostatic interactions favorable for agonistic activities toward PPAR{$\gamma$}, but unfavorable for agonistic activities toward ER{$\alpha$}. The halogenation at the phenolic rings of BPAs exerts more impact on molecular electrostatic potential distribution than halogenation at the bridging alkyl moiety. Different halogenations further alter hydrogen bond interactions of BPAs and induce conformational changes of PPAR{$\gamma$} ligand binding domain (LBD) and ER{$\alpha$} LBD, specifically affecting the stabilization of helix H12 attributable to the different agonistic activities. Our results indicate that structural variations in halogenation patterns result in different interactions of BPAs with PPAR{$\gamma$} LBD and ER{$\alpha$} LBD, potentially causing distinct agonistic/antagonistic toxic effects. The various halogenation patterns should be fully considered for the design of future environmentally benign chemicals with reduced toxicities and desired properties.},

  abstract = {Appropriate self-renewal and differentiation of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) are key factors for proper placental development and function and, in turn, for appropriate in utero fetal growth. To identify novel TSC-specific genes, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of TSCs, embryonic stem cells, epiblast stem cells, and mouse embryo fibroblasts, derived from mice of the same genetic background. Our analysis revealed a high expression of Sox21 in TSCs compared with other cell types. Sox21 levels were high in undifferentiated TSCs and were dramatically reduced upon differentiation. In addition, modulation of Sox21 expression in TSCs affected lineage-specific differentiation, based on both marker analysis and functional assessment. Our results implicate Sox21 specifically in the promotion of spongiotrophoblast and giant cell differentiation and establish a new mechanism through which trophoblast sublineages are specified.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},
